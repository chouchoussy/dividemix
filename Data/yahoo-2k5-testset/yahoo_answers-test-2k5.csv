"Buddhism  is the one exception and is quite happy with the theory of evolution. In fact Buddhist philosophy actually requires evolution to take place -  all things are seen as being transient, constantly becoming, existing for a while and then fading.  The idea of unchanging species would not be compatible with Buddhist ontology .\nBuddhism is the only major religion which acknowledges a large area of ignorance about external matters. Unlike other religions, it does not even attempt to answer questions like 'What is the purpose of life, the universe and everything?' . Buddhism regards such questions as at best unanswerable and probably intrinsically meaningless. The only purpose of life is what we personally give to our own lives. Buddha suggested that the most meaningful use of life was to seek liberation from ignorance, suffering and the cycle of samsaric rebirth, both for one's self and others. But this 'meaning' does not reside 'in the sky' or in any way outside of the individual, and it cannot be imposed, but must be freely chosen.\n\nMost other religions go further than Buddhism, and if asked 'What is the purpose of life, the universe and everything?' will usually come up with an answer along the lines of 'To fulfil the will of God.'\n\nThis invites the further question of 'What is the will of God', which usually brings forth an answer to the effect that 'God's will is to create life, the universe and everything'.\n\nno, because the belief in the creator god is not necessary. but, there are some same things about other religions that we can share with (example: love & charity).\n\n***We don't want to say that Buddhism is a kind of Christianity and Christianity is a kind of Buddhism. A mango can not be an orange. I cannot accept the fact that a mango is an orange. They are two different things. Vive la difference. But when you look deeply into the mango and into the orange, you see that although they are different they are both fruits. If you analyze the mango and the orange deeply enough, you will see small elements are in both, like the sunshine, the clouds, the sugar, and the acid. If you spend time looking deeply enough, you will discover that the only difference between them lies in the degree, in the emphasis. At first you see the difference between the orange and the mango. But if you look a little deeper, you discover many things in common. In the orange you find acid and sugar which is in the mango too. Even two oranges taste different; one can be very sour and one can be very sweet.",0

"Meditation and self-hypnosis tend to be different flavours of a very similar state. \n\nWith a structured outline for your session, self-hypnosis can be orchestrated by your conscious mind to actually achieve particular outcomes.

"Literacy is one of the fastest changing arenas in education today.  The very idea that literacy simply means the ability to read and write is no longer valid (though that is what the word literally means).  The new ideas of literacy focus on students' individual prior knowledge, how they use that prior knowledge to navigate through particular subject matter and finally what the student is able to accomplish.  I have even heard talk (and I don't by into this much, but it is the 'buzz') that literacy doesn't necessarily mean being able to read about baseball, but if the student can tell you about baseball and play baseball, even if they can't read about baseball, is still somewhat literate in that subject.\n\nWhat does this mean for Language teachers?  Hmmm, I don't think it means much other that we have to modify how we view our assesment of student achievement.  We have to be a little more open and creative when monitoring and assessing the education progress of each student taking into account (and being more cognizant of) individual learning styles and modalities.  \n\nThis is a good thing in the fact that you can, with a little (lot) more effort reach more of your students...but it also gives the legislature more slosh room for ""NCLB"" standards and benchmarks.  We still, as Language teachers, have to focus on the reading and writing, but the legislation says that we, and esp. if the IEP states, can now take grades and make alternative assessments if if the child in question is unable to do the classical showing of proficiency (as long as they can, in some way show they have learned the material).\n\nSo, I am not sure if I answered the question as you would have liked.  I am in the habit of being verbose and this particular area can get pretty heavy between petagogy, philosophy, legislation, and personal vision.  All in all the effort is to try and make sure all students are able to show a certain amount of proficiency in a myriad of ways...while (by some miracle) being able to perform adaquately on their particular state's madatory assessment tool.\n\nTO me...I still do my job and expect my students to know and be able to do everything I ask of them...even if it is hard.  I follow state mandates regarding benchmarks, IEP's, ESOL, etc...  I do engage in alternative assessment, but it still is a language class...thus they, in the end, have to be able to read, comprehend and compose proficiently.",3
"American English suffers ""colonial lag"", meaning that the English that is spoken in America has roots in the 17th century and then diverged. British English evolved in ways that American English did not. \n\nThere's sentence structures Americans use that British do not. Like ""have gotten"", that ""en"" ending with ""have"" is an old form of English.\n\nYou'll see that in the French of Montreal, Quebeq, Canada too. \n\nI see it in my mother's Japanese, it's very pre WWII and she taught me ""old fashioned"" Japanese that make modern Japanese people laugh. ""You sound like my grandmother."" They would say. Hey! I was taught by a grandmother. \n\nIreland has colonial lag too. If you read Shakespear with an Irish accent the rhymes would work. \n\nIn England there's a class system. So one's station in life can be deduced by the accent one has. Changing one's class is more difficult because one's accent would show where someone came from. I think that's why there are so many different accents in England and smaller pockets of the population that speak them. There's history behind it. \n\nAmericans don't have a class system like that. There's a lot of movement up and down the social ladder caused by wealth or the loss of wealth. I think that national TV is blurring the lines of the accents in America. There are classes on how to loose a regional accent when going into business. What is the dominant accent... watch the TV News. The ""Walter Cronkite"" accent.  \n\nThe slang in England and America will be different and that's the most difficult thing for a non-native speaker to learn. You would not call a small pack worn with a belt around your waist a ""fanny pack"" in England. That's very naughty. It's not naughty in America. Americans don't call a cigarette a ""f a g"". That comes from ""faggot"" which lit the fuse on cannons. In America it means a homosexual. \n\nBritish speakers of English have difficult with the slang in Australia. Australians with Americans. We all share English but after the colonies were established the English evolved in different directions. \n\nThe main difference between British and American use of English will be seen with the vowels. I'd focus on that if I were you.  Speakers of British English don't open their mouths as wide as Americans. Reading their lips is a little more difficult.\n\nIf you have a DVD player, get a movie that is made in English, put on the English Captions, listen to the movie and look at how the words are spelled out. That's the cheapest way to learn a language. To witness it in action, in a situation, because language is more than the words, it's gestures, eye contact, how close you stand to someone when speaking.\n\nJust look at the French when they shrug their shoulders. Both shoulders are used, their hands go up, they pucker their lips, tilt their head. It's a full body ""I don't know"" motion. What you hear may be just a ""pffft"" sound. \n\nSo watching movies will help in the non-verbal communication. \n\nYou're going to be using a different side of your head reading English. Chinese characters come in the brain like art, sounds of birds, that sort of thing because they are pictures that have meaning. Alphabets that make words that are used in sentences use the other side of the brain, where math is processed. \n\nYou got your work cut out for you. Good luck.",0

"An ocean current is any more or less permanent or continuous, directed movement of ocean water that flows in one of the Earth's oceans.\n\nSurface ocean currents are generally wind driven and develop their typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere due to the imposed wind stresses. In wind driven currents the Ekman spiral effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds. The areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the seasons, this is most notable in equatorial currents.\n\nDeep ocean currents are driven by density and temperature gradients. Thermohaline circulation, also known as the ocean's conveyor belt, refers to the deep ocean density-driven ocean basin currents. These currents that flow under the surface of the ocean, and are thus hidden from immediate detection, are called submarine rivers. These are currently being researched by floating devices, which maintain their depth according to slightly differing densities of waters. Upwelling and downwelling areas in the oceans are areas, where significant vertical movement of ocean water is observed.",1

"Rwanda's Struggle to Recover from Genocide\nDespite efforts by Rwanda’s new government, the United Nations (UN), and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Rwanda’s recovery from genocide has been slow and far from steady. At a December 1997 press conference, United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed that the United States and Rwanda “must account for the past in order to forge a more just future.” In the following article, written for Encarta Yearbook, author Gérard Prunier explains why this may be difficult to accomplish.\n\n\nRwanda's Struggle to Recover from Genocide\n\nBy Gérard Prunier\n\n\nOne of the 20th century's worst atrocities—the brutal slaughter of approximately 800,000 people in the East African nation of Rwanda in 1994—still demands an accounting.\n\n\nThree years after the genocide ended, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), created by the United Nations (UN), has yet to bring a war criminal to justice. In contrast, the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), established in 1993 to try war crimes committed during the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has proceeded relatively smoothly. The ICTY reached its first conviction in May 1997. The ICTR's lack of progress has led many Rwandans to believe that the outside world is more concerned about “ethnic cleansing” in Europe than about mass atrocities in east central Africa.\n\n\nOn April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down by unknown assailants as his plane approached the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Habyarimana's death triggered a chain of events in which neighbor turned on neighbor and friend upon friend. Murders occurred within families as ethnic Hutu killed their ethnic Tutsi relatives. Many Hutu priests refused asylum to Tutsi fugitives, and some Hutu schoolteachers actually murdered their Tutsi students. Although the violence appeared spontaneous, it was in fact planned. Many reports in Western news media inaccurately described what was happening as a tribal conflict. The true causes lay elsewhere.\n\nRoots of the Conflict\n\n\nThe conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi in east central Africa was not new. Nor was it the product of ancient tribal hatreds as was so often reported. The Hutu and Tutsi are not tribes. A tribe is a distinct community with its own language, customs, territory, and religion. Hutu and Tutsi in the nations of Rwanda and Burundi share the same territory, speak the same languages (Kinyarwanda in Rwanda, Kirundi in Burundi), share the same customs, practice the same religion, and frequently intermarry. The real difference between the majority Hutu (who make up between 80 and 85 percent of the population in Rwanda and Burundi) and the minority Tutsi (between 12 and 15 percent in both countries) is sociopolitical.\n\n\nThe aboriginal inhabitants of the area now known as Rwanda were the Twa. Rwanda's Hutu migrated to the region later and were well established by the time the Tutsi arrived in the 1400s. This early precolonial society was hierarchical, with Tutsi serving as the ruling aristocracy. Their status was linked to the ownership of cattle, a symbol of social distinction in many East African societies.\n\n\nHutus were not allowed to own cattle unless the cattle were given to them by a Tutsi overlord. The granting of cattle, a ceremonial process called ubuhake in Kinyarwanda, was an essential link between Tutsi social patrons and their Hutu clients. For example, Hutu soldiers who served their Tutsi masters well in war were often rewarded with cattle.\n\n\nWars in the region were frequent, but they did not pit Tutsi against Hutu. Rather, they were civil conflicts between high lineage Tutsis who were supported by their Hutu retainers in a system similar to that of medieval Europe. Or they were wars between the kingdom of Rwanda and the neighboring kingdoms of Iweju, Mpororo, Nkore, or Buha, which toda",3

"Celiac sprue (AKA celiac disease or Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy), is a chronic disease of the digestive tract.  It is a *genetic* disease that is characterized\nby autoimmune damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine when gluten is ingested.\n\nPeople with CS cannot tolerate gluten in any form (gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats).  When gluten is ingested by people with the disease, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, which results in maldigestion and malabsorption.\n\nSymptoms vary but can include severe gas pain, stomach pain, malodorous and oily stools and/or profuse diarrhea, and weight loss.\n\nBecause it is a genetic, inheritable disease, there is no true prevention.

"VISIT :\n\nhttp://africanamerica.org/groupee/forums?m=63070547&a=tpc&cdra=Y&s=60260642&f=40070883D\n\nAND/OR READ:\n\n\n\nThis is exactly the kind of hostile rejection that the prominent role of women in the early church has faced for hundreds of years.\n\nCanon Edward Norman, a noted Church historian in England, has defined this as a struggle between ""dubious feminist theology"" and ""rigorous \nscholarship.""\n\nNotice that Norman says that the only things we know about Mary Magdalene come from the Gospels. Yet, he goes on to say that what we have there is an \naccount of a ""repentant ex-prostitute"" who became a faithful follower of Jesus. If anyone's theology is dubious here it is Norman's. It is a fact that the Bible does not say that Mary Magdalene was ever a prostitute. I pointed this out in my essay. Yet, Norman can blatantly say that the Gospels portray her as a repentant ex-prostitute. Even as he is saying that ""there is no other source"" of knowledge about Mary Magdalene other than the Bible, he strongly asserts that she was an ex-prostitute even though that notion comes to us from extrabiblical noncanonical sources.\n\nRigorous scholarship reveals that there is no reference to Mary Magdalene as a prostitute at all in the Bible. If anything, ""dubious traditionalist theology"" has thought it important enough to label Mary Magdalene as a \nprostitute even though the Gospels do not say that. It is the traditionalist view that engages in much speculation about Mary Magdalene. It is kind of \namazing when you think of all the stories, homilies, and sermons that go on and on about Magdalene the ""penitent whore."" Most people think that this \ncomes from the Bible simply because it has been repeated so often.\n\nTraditionalist church historians have no problem believing sources outside of the Scriptures IF those sources do not challenge their own notions. For \nexample, most of them teach that Paul was beheaded by the Romans between 66-69 AD. They teach that Peter was crucified upside down. They teach that \nJohn lived to be 90 or 100 years old in exile. ALL of this information comes to us from noncanonical writings. And they are all probably true. However, noncanonical writings that challenge their own ideas are quickly and \nsummarily discredited and not even seriously discussed.\n\nMy point is that traditionalist scholars like Norman seem to believe that they are unbiased and objective while the scholars that they don't agree with are biased, slanted, and pushing an agenda with ulterior motives. In fact, we can see from Norman's statements that he seems to be pushing an agenda himself. He seems intent on perpetuating this image of Mary Magdalene \nas an ex-prostitute even though he knows that the Scripture says no such thing. And yet he says that this account comes from the Gospels!! He KNOWS \nthat the Bible says no such thing. Well, I'm assuming that he knows. If he doesn't, then he can't be much of a church historian.\n\nIt is ""dubious traditionalist theology"" that maintains that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute even though the Bible does not say that. It is the same ""dubious traditionalist theology"" that maintains that the Beloved Disciple is St. John even though the Bible does not say that either.\n\nThe traditionalist view(s) are NOT free of all bias. Therefore, it is fair to scrutinize widely held beliefs even if they have been believed for a long \ntime.\n\n\n\n\n1830 ~ 1912 \n\nby Patricia Chadwick\nwww.historyswomen.com \n\nThe name “Mary Magdalene” can evoke different images to various people. Many see her as a deranged woman suffering from being possessed by demons, while others view her as a fallen woman, even a prostitute. Although the Biblical record is not silent on the matter, we are only given a few details about the life of Mary Magdalene in the Bible - and you may be surprised what the Scripture do",0

"Family and species - The variety of sea lions which live at Sea Lion Caves is commonly called the Northern, or Steller, sea lion. This sea lion is named after George Wilhelm Steller, an eminent German naturalist who accompanied the Russian explorer Vitus Bering in 1741 on his second Alaskan expedition. Steller was the first qualified observer to study and classify these animals.\nThe Steller sea lion is a member of the Otariidae family, or eared seal. It is characterized by an external ear which can be closed when entering water and by hind feet or flippers that point forward. In contrast, Phocidae, or true seal, has no external ears and it's rear flippers point backward. Also belonging to the Otariidae family is the California sea lion and the Alaska fur seal.\nThe Alaska fur seal (Callorhinus alascanus), is not found at Sea Lion Caves. The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) is seen all along the Pacific Coast and is generally found at Sea Lion Caves from late fall to early spring. It readily adapts to captivity and is trained for circus acts.\nThe largest of the eared seal family and the principal tenant of Sea Lion Caves is the Steller sea lion. This animal is also considered non-migratory because there is no mass movement to summer or winter grounds, although individuals or small groups may travel hundreds of miles in search of food. It is found from the central California coast, north to the Bering Sea and back south into northern Japanese waters. A recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Survey indicates a possible total population of nearly 80,000 Steller sea lions. Most of these animals live on the offshore islands and rocks of British Columbia and Alaska. Some Stellers live along the California coast and about one thousand reside in Oregon Waters. The number of Steller sea lions in the Sea Lion Caves area varies from season to season and from year to year with the herd averaging about 200 animals.\n\nPhysical Characteristics - Sea Lions are mammals, or warm blooded animals which give birth, nurse their offspring, and must breathe air. Sea Lions are also pinnipeds -- literally, feather-footed -- meaning they have finlike members for propulsion. Their pelvic bone structure allows independent use of their flippers, and therefore, they can walk on their four weblike flippers which contain the same bony structure as the legs of land animals. In the water, the Steller sea lion swims by using a breast stroke and may reach a top speed of about 17 m.p.h. In contrast, other marine animals, such as the whale, depend on fishlike body action to move through the water. The true fur seal folds its front flippers and swims by the force of its trailing rear flippers.\nYoung sea lions called pups seem to be immune to most diseases as long as they are breast fed. As they mature, pups become susceptible to internal parasites such as round worms and tape worms which are a deterrent to both growth and longevity. Population increases are also somewhat checked by adult sea lions inadvertently trampling their young and also by accidental drownings of the newly born which have not yet learned to swim.\nDiet - Sea lions are carnivorous. Their skulls are similar to those of bears and their jaws contain sharp teeth much like those found in dogs, cats, and other flesh eaters. They feed exclusively on fish they catch themselves; their diet varying with whatever is abundant in the area. In the vicinity of Sea Lion Caves, they appear to subsist chiefly on bottom fish such as skate, small sharks, squid and various species of rock fish. Sea lions may descend in search of food to a depth of 80 to 100 fathoms, and normally remain submerged no longer then four or five minutes.\nPossible sea lion predation on commercially valuable fish has been of some concern. Because of the animal's remote and rugged habitat, and because collecting specimens at sea is difficult, much is unknown about its diet habits. However, recent scientific studies indicate th",1

"The gyroball is the name given to a breaking baseball pitch purported to be used by players in Japan. The pitch was developed by two Japanese researchers, Ryutaro Himeno and Kazushi Tezuka, who used computer simulations to create a new style of delivery intended to reduce stress on the pitcher. At the point of release, instead of having the pitcher's arm move inwards towards the body (the standard method used in the United States), the pitcher rotates his arm so that it moves away from his body, towards 3rd base. The unusual method of delivery creates a bullet-like spin on the ball, like a bicycle tire spins when facing the spokes or a perfectly thrown football. When thrown by a right hander, the pitch moves sharply down and away from right handed batters and towards left handed batters.\n\nIn baseball, most pitches are thrown with backspin, like the fastball, or with a more forward spinning motion, like the curveball and the slider. Batters use the arm speed of the pitcher and the spin on a baseball, highlighted by the seams, to judge the speed of the ball. The gyroball is thrown with the arm speed of a fastball but goes much slower, and since it has a bullet-like spinning motion, on occasion (perhaps when the seams are hidden from view of the batter) it will make experienced batters swing wildly ahead or behind the ball.\n\nThe gyroball is one of the available pitches in Baseball Mogul 2007, a baseball computer game. In that game, the trajectory of the ball looks similar to a flat fastball or change up, with a late lateral break (away from right-handed batters as thrown by right-handed pitchers). It was once thought that the only pitcher in the game that possesses the gyroball in his arsenal is Daisuke Matsuzaka. However, he himself says that he is just trying to learn how to throw it [1].\n\nThe gyroball is also often confused with a completely different Japanese pitch called the shuuto, due to an error in a well-known article by baseball writer Will Carroll (see external link). Although Carroll later corrected himself, the confusion still persists.",5

"Why Do Hindus Worship Many Gods?\n\nHuman beings through history have formulated many different names and forms for the Divine or Eternal. Just as we have many names and forms for other things, whether it is foods, or types of art, so too, in religion a similar great diversity has been created.\n\nThe Western world has prided itself in monotheism, the idea that there is only One God as the highest truth. Western religions have said that only the names and forms which refer to this One God are valid but those which appear to worship another God, or a multiplicity of divinities, must be false. They have restricted the names and forms they use in religious worship, and insist that only one set is true and correct and others are wrong or unholy. \n\nAs a universal formulation Hinduism accepts all formulations of Truth. According to the universal view there is only One Reality, but it cannot be limited to a particular name or form. Though Truth is One it is also Universal, not an exclusive formulation. It is an inclusive, not an exclusive Oneness - a spiritual reality of Being - Consciousness - Bliss, which could be called God but which transcends all names. The different Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism represent various functions of this One Supreme Divinity, and are not separate Gods. \n(Having many names for something is not necessarily a sign of ignorance of its real nature. On the contrary, it may indicate an intimate knowledge of it. For example, Eskimos have forty-eight different names for snow in their language because they know snow intimately in its different variations, not because they are ignorant of the fact that all snow is only one. The many different deities of Hinduism reflect such an intimate realization of the Divine on various levels.)",0

"Emotional highs and lows are part of life for everyone. But for someone with bipolar disorder, these ups and downs can be so extreme they can interfere with daily life. Sometimes they can even be dangerous. \n\nOne day a person with bipolar disorder may feel so depressed that they can't get out of bed. Work may seem impossible. \n\nOn another day that person may feel great, full of endless energy and creativity. But other people might think that their actions are reckless and out of control. \n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong medical condition that can be confusing and unpredictable, but it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Learning more about bipolar disorder can be helpful in managing this medical illness. \n\nThere are four main types of bipolar disorder: \nBipolar I Disorder \nBipolar II Disorder \nCyclothymic Disorder \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified \n\n\nBipolar I Disorder - Bipolar I disorder involves one or more manic or mixed episodes, and often one or more major depressive episodes. A depressive episode may last for several weeks or months. Between episodes of bipolar I disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n\nBipolar II Disorder - Bipolar II disorder involves one or more major depressive episodes along with at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less severe. Between episodes of bipolar II disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n \nCyclothymic Disorder - Cyclothymic disorder is a long-term fluctuating mood disturbance with periods of hypomania and periods of depression. It is a milder form of bipolar disorder. That's because the periods of both depression and hypomania are shorter, less severe, and do not occur with regularity.\n \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified - This type of bipolar disorder is when the person does not fit into the types of bipolar disorder mentioned above. The experiences of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. Just like the other types of bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is treatable.",2

"Most of time people are afraid of free stuff via internet because usually they have been victim of scams.\nHowever, there is good free stuff out there. The reason being:\n\n1. Advertising with your consent. Usually ones that are with bad intentions install adware, spyware, tracking software, key loggers, and etc. Good ones are ones that they want you to use their product and promote them by letting others. Good Example of good softwares are,\n\nwww.firefox.com : Less error/issues than Internet Explorer.\n\nwww.openoffice.org : It's same as Microsoft Office, except you don't pay for it.\n\nLinux OS, typically for people who doesn't want to pay for OS software.(I think RedHat Linux, you might have to pay for latest ones)\n\nwww.lavasoft.com : Good adware/spyware removal. Free for personal use.\n\n2. Feedback. Most of programs are tested and runs good, however in order to be tested they need to be run on various type of computer with various components which it would cost the companies sharply high. Best way is give out programs to general people to use and when there's error, it allows people to choose whether or not you want to send feed back data to them so that they can study.(Companies uses the error feedback to study them and fix/optimize their software)\n\n3. Good for the people that doesn't want to pay or poor. People that understands good and benefit of certain programs really can enjoy. Example of that would be using Yahoo messenger/service etc. \n\n4. Sales/Market promotion/Advertisement benefit by spreading programs.\n\nI hope these answer your question. ç=^D",4

"The word 'Son' as far as God is concerned refers to his creations. When we pray, do we not say ""Our Father in the Heavens""?

We can all relate to a father; most of us have had one.\n\nJesus was created before the angels, before the earth, before anything and everything. He helped God create everything else. Jehovah God himself calls him his ""only-begotten son"". He's the one he sent to earth to redeem us. \n\nAs for the Bible suffering corruption - just think about this, if God is powerful enough to create us, to destroy us, don't you think he can preserve his word alive?

"First I'd have to examine the similarities. They are all, most likely, what was once simply the instinct to procreate.  \n\nThese words are symbols like all words, the concepts they represent to us are broad and almost undefinable.  For instance, there are many different ""flavors"" of love.  This really means that the word ""love"" actually covers many different concepts that have similarities but are not identical (brotherly love, a mother's love, romantic love).  Likewise when one is ""infatuated"" with a new band, it means something quite different from when one is ""infatuated"" with a person.\n\nHow they have become different would perhaps be related to the varying stages of a romantic relationship.   At first there is lust, it is strongly driven by hormones making it feel like raw primal desire.  If you continue to see the person you may become infatuated with them, meaning that thinking about the person consumes most of your attention, all day.  This phase is terribly distracting, every other second you find the person popping into your head.  Finally, if you keep spending time with the person you may develop love, a deep caring for their wellbeing and an emotional attachment that would hurt you if it were broken.  At this point it becomes more similar to familiar love like a mother and child, but retains a certain amount of lustiness and infatuation.  In a good relationship, the partners both work to keep love, infatuation and lust strong.",8

McClellan, a rising military star in Ohio, proposed an overall strategy for the war directly to President Abraham Lincoln, one that emphasized the part his army could play. Scott, the general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, wrote a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861, stating in part:\n\nIt is the design of the Government to raise 25,000 additional regular troops, and 60,000 volunteers, for three years. ... We rely greatly on the sure operation of a complete blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports soon to commence. In connection with such blockade, we propose a powerful movement down the Mississippi to the ocean, with a cordon of posts at proper points ... the object being to clear out and keep open this great line of communication in connection with the strict blockade of the seaboard, so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.[1]\n\nScott went on to warn against hot-headed demands for a march on the Confederate capital, Richmond.\n\nScott's plan involved two main parts.\n\nBlockade the coast of the South to prevent the export of cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops from the South and to keep them from importing much-needed war supplies. \nDivide the South by controlling the Mississippi River to cut off the southeastern states from the western. Scott considered this an ""envelopment"" rather than an ""invasion"", although it would require armies and fleets of river gunboats to accomplish it. \nHis proposal received considerable public criticism at the time. A famous newspaper cartoon depicted a huge snake squeezing the Confederacy, thus giving the plan its popular name. The United States government never formally adopted it, but President Lincoln did implement the two parts. However, he ignored Scott's warning against direct invasion, and used far more troops (nearly two million), trying repeatedly to capture Richmond.\n\nLincoln called for a blockade of the South on April 19, 1861, six days after the fall of Fort Sumter (and a few weeks before Scott's letter). The blockade itself, thought to be an impossible task against 3,000 miles of highly irregular coastline, was an unparalleled success within the first six months, and nearly impregnable within the first two years. The blockade accounted for the vast increase in the price of cotton abroad and the extreme scarcity of manufactured goods in the South by the end of the war, contributing to the South's defeat. It was the most successful naval blockade to date, and the first",9

":}\nThe Seven Virtues were derived from the Psychomachia , an epic poem written by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius entailing the battle of good virtues and evil vices. \n\n1.  Pride vs. Humility         Seeing ourselves as we are and not comparing ourselves to others is humility. Pride and vanity are competitive. If someone else's pride really bothers you, you have a lot of pride.\n2.  Envy vs. Love           ""Love is patient, love is kind…"" Love actively seeks the good of others for their sake. Envy resents the good others receive or even might receive. Envy is almost indistinguishable from pride at times.\n3.   Wrath/Anger vs. Kindness          Kindness means taking the tender approach, with patience and compassion. Anger is often our first reaction to the problems of others. Impatience with the faults of others is related to this.\n4. Sloth vs. Zeal           Zeal is the energetic response of the heart to God's commands. The other sins work together to deaden the spiritual senses so we first become slow to respond to God and then drift completely into the sleep of complacency.\n5. Avarice/Greed vs. Generosity        This is about more than money. Generosity means letting others get the credit or praise. It is giving without having expectations of the other person. Greed wants to get its ""fair share"" or a bit more.\n6.  Gluttony vs. Faith and Temperance     Temperance accepts the natural limits of pleasures and preserves this natural balance. This does not pertain only to food, but to entertainment and other legitimate goods, and even the company of others.\n7.    Lust vs. Self control          Self  control and self mastery prevent pleasure from killing the soul by suffocation. Legitimate pleasures are controlled in the same way an athlete's muscles are: for maximum efficiency without damage. Lust is the self-destructive drive for pleasure out of proportion to its worth. Sex, power, or image can be used well, but they tend to go out of control.",0

"From 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.”\n During the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. 177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \n During the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \n The Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \n Over the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artillery shells were fired. All this translates to about 24-30 million “sub munitions” or bomblets. Assuming a dud rate of 5%, it is estimated that the number of Dangerous land-mine cluster bomblets lying on or just under the surface of the ground in Iraq and Kuwait would be from 1.2 to 1.5 million. At least. In the desert, however, the percentage of these duds rose to 30%. So the number of unexploded ordnance still lying in wait for unsuspecting Iraqi children and civilian people could be as high as 7 to 9 million bomblets. A Human Rights Watch report says that of the estimated 24 to 30 mi",9

"To begin with, there is no concept of ""pass"" or ""fail"" on the test.  It is just a matter of whether or not your score meets the criteria of a particular school to which you are applying.  Secondly, the test was really designed to be an aptitude test, not an achievement test.  If you talk to most people who did really well on the test, they did not study at all, but simply had the basic understanding of how to figure out the answers to begin with.  Unless you are suffering from major test anxiety each time you take the exam (in which case I would advise a prep course), it is unlikely that simply studying on your own will raise your scores significantly.

"6 points is a DRASTIC increase, and most research shows that retesters often score lower.\n\nWhy does she need to score so much higher? If it is for a school, I'd suggest looking into a school that more appropriately suits her talents and abilities.\n\nHowever, if you and her are intent on increasing it, I'd suggest a program through Kaplan. It is expensive though. If she'll self study, the ACT prep book published by the College Board themselves was very helpful to me.\n\nIf she is not a Junior currently, know that her score will increase. We took an old version of the ACT in my Sophomore year. I got a 28 then. When I took it my Junior year, I got a 34. Obviously, that is a drastic increase. If she is younger, get her studying now. Have her take AP classes to boost her knowledge. Have her take practice tests. Make sure on the real test day, she has gotten adequate  sleep and eats a healthy breakfast. Help her feel confident going into the test, and she'll likely do better!\n\nIf she is a Junior currently, she may not be able to boost her score that much, but it will still help to try some study books or programs. Also, most if not all schools will accept the ACT and SAT interchangeably. I personally did worse on the SAT than on the ACT, but I know many people who did better on the SAT. Maybe she could sign up to try to take that.\n\nI hope she gets the results she hopes for, but don't let her beat herself up about it! Whatever your score-14, or 34, she'll end up somewhere good for HER. If her score doesn't accurately reflect her abilities and talents, there are other places on an application to make those clear. Work on helping her write a strong personal statement for instance.\n\nGood luck to both of you!\n-Nicole",3

"I am a retired police officer with over 20 years experience in the New Orleans area.  In that time, I have never had a case where the presence of a weapon made any real difference in what took place at your ""average"" burglary.  Meaning a random burglary where an armed homeowner was present in no way influenced the crimes outcome.  Yes, I have had homeowners shooting at potential burglars but for the most part, burglars when confronted don't stick around.  Of course, there are exceptions.  \n\nMy point is that for the average homeowner having weapons in the house is merely a ""feel"" good measure and does not offer any kind of deterrent to a burglar.  Residences that are known to have weapons can ultimately become ""targets"" because the criminal is looking for those weapons.  And believe me, burglars have ways of finding out if you have a cache of weapons.\n\n\nTo answer your question, while it is true that Glocks are ""good to go"" and could be used against you by an attacker, the opposite is also true for other ""more complicated"" handguns.  In stressful situation such as a home invasion, if you are not well trained on the weapon's use, you could very well forget to release the safety yourself and thus become a victim anyway.   \n\nIt is well documented that in some police shootings, the police officers were killed with their weapons in hand with the safeties still engaged.  In fact some departments switched to Glocks for that very reason.  If you are concerned about the Glock, you could always leave the first round out of the chamber which would then require you to pull the slide back before firing thus acting as a safety and giving you more time to react if the intruder takes you weapon away.\n\nI think that there are always variables beyond your control and to worry whether or not to keep a Glock or a Berretta (which can be complicated to operate) is a moot point.  \n\nSomeone else suggested a shotgun.  It is the same scenerio.  You would have to release the safety before you could ""protect"" yourself and I have seen countless times in shotgun training.  Police officers jump out their units to engage a target and 50% of them will forget to release the safety.  I have done it myself.  It is a horrible feeling to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.  Not to mention embarassing when theirs 20 other policer officers staring at you!\n\nMy advise is to reconsider arming yourself, especially if you have a family.  There is also a liability issue to consider should you harm someone other than the burglar.  Rounds don't stop at you front lawn!  \nIf you must have a weapon take the responsibility to train and become proficient with it's use regardless of the make and model.  If you choose the glock, leave the first round out of the chamber but keep the magazine loaded.  As far as what caliber, if you goal is to shoot to kill, don't get anything smaller than a .40 cal.  If you want to wound and maybe get lucky and kill em go for a 9mm.\n\nThat's just my opinion!",5

"From the book Dulce by Branton ..... The Feb.-Mar. 1991 issue of 'UFO UNIVERSE' carried an article titled 'THE DEEP DARK SECRET AT DULCE', written by Bill Hamilton and 'TAL' LeVesque. If planet earth is to be the central 'battleground' or staging-ground for a final cosmic battle between galactic superpowers, and if the U.S. is one of the major areas on earth where the 'final outcome' will be decided, and since the Dulce, New Mexico area is considered to be THE MAJOR BASING SITE where human - alien collaboration AND/OR conflict is taking place, then we should focus our attention on what has been going on deep beneath this small southwestern town. More than any other area in the U.S., if not the world... this small town has been the epicenter for nearly ever form of paranormal activity one can imagine, including: UFO sightings, UFO landings, Abductions, Implantation's, Human & Animal mutilations, PSI Warfare studies, Secret Government-Alien interaction, U.S. 'Constitutional' Government vs. Alien Agenda conflicts, 'Reptilian' sightings, Cryptozoological or Bioengineering phenomena [this was the general area where the  famous 'Cabbit', the half cat / half rabbit was captured], Underground bases, Conspiracy scenarios, Alien Infiltration, Deep-Cavern phenomena, Super High-Tech activity, & MIB encounters. In fact a higher CONCENTRATION of such activities has been evident in the vicinity of Dulce than any other area in the world, to the point that the inhabitants of this town have for the most part resigned themselves into acknowledging -- although not necessarily accepting -- the reality of such activity, whether they like it or not. \nBill Hamilton and 'TAL' Levesque take us 'inside' the Hadean-like labyrinths deep within this underground megacomplex, through the eyes of those who have actually been there, so brace yourselves: \n""Dulce is a sleepy little town in northern New Mexico. It's population is about 900 and it is located above 7,000 feet on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation. There is one major motel and just a few stores. It is not a resort town and it is not bustling with activity. Yet, according to a few outsiders, Dulce harbors a deep, dark secret. That secret is said to be harbored deep below the tangled brush of Archuleta Mesa. That secret involves a joint government-alien biogenetic laboratory designed to carry out bizarre experiments on humans and animals. \n""New Mexico State Police Officer Gabe Valdez was drawn into the mysteries of Dulce when called out to investigate a mutilated cow on the Manuel Gomez ranch in a pasture 13 miles east of Dulce. Gomez had lost four cattle to mutilations between 1976 and June 1978 (and SEVERAL more in ensuing years. - Branton) when a team of investigators which included Tom Adams arrived from Paris, Texas to examine the site of the carcass. \n""Curious as to how cattle were being selected by the mysterious mutilators, an interesting experiment was conducted on July 5, 1978 by Valdez, Gomez, and retired scientist Howard Burgess. The three penned up about 120 of the Gomez beef cattle and moved them through a squeeze chute under an ultra-violet light. They found a 'glittery substance on the right side of the neck, the right ear, and the right leg.' Samples of the affected hides were removed as well as control samples from the same animals. \n""Some investigators attribute the mutilations to aliens from UFOs. Sightings of strange lights and other aerial phenomena have been reported in many areas where the cows have been found at the time of the reported mutilation. UFOs have been seen frequently around Dulce. \n""I arrived in Dulce on April 19, 1988, to visit with Gabe Valdez and to inquire about the sightings, the mutes, and the rumors of an underground alien base in the area.

"Neem’s wide variety of reported benefits include use in the treatment of fever, gastrointestinal disease, dermatologic (skin) disorders, immune dysfunction, respiratory disease, parasites, inflammatory conditions, and infections by some bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Some components have been shown to have antimalarial properties. The seeds contain an insecticidal substance that is EPA approved for use on nonfood crops. Some viral diseases have been treated by components of neem. It may inhibit the multiplication of viruses and prevent them from entering and infecting cells. Some of the diseases that have reportedly been relieved include colds, flu, and conditions caused by herpes, such as chickenpox and shingles. Neem appears to be an appropriate treatment for numerous dermatologic indications. Its anti-inflammatory and pain relieving activity make it potentially useful against psoriasis, eczema, acne, dermatitis, and an assortment of fungal conditions. The neem leaf has been shown to have activity that suppresses the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, ringworm, and Candida. Seed oil and aqueous leaf extracts have been used to treat jock itch, another fungal infection. The oil and leaf extract may be applied externally in the form of lotions and soaps. Leaf preparations may also be used internally for the detoxification properties. Poultices made from the leaf have antiseptic and astringent properties that treat wounds and boils. Both internal and external parasites may be sensitive to the effects of neem. External parasites, such as lice and mites, are often treated in India with aqueous extracts of neem leaves. A medical research center in Nagercoil, India, found that a combination of neem and turmeric cured 97% of patients with scabies within 3–15 days of treatment. Teas are used against internal parasites, including intestinal worms. Perhaps one of the most interesting claims for neem is for the prevention and treatment of malaria. Leaf extracts are said to have the same effectiveness as quinine and chloroquine, the conventional medications that are used. Some studies show that even chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria are sensitive to neem, particularly a component called Irodin A. The recommended preventative measure is to chew and consume the leaves on a daily basis. Twigs and leaves of the neem tree may be used for oral hygiene, and neem bark extracts used in toothpastes and mouthwashes are active against gingivitis. Ayurveda holds that neem has healthful properties for teeth and gum tissue. Ayurvedic tradition holds that neem bark improves resistance to disease. It appears that certain carbohydrates contained in the bark do indeed stimulate the production of antibodies. One source recommends a cyclical use of neem to strengthen the immune system in order to lower the incidence of infections, particularly in people who have conditions that compromise the immune system. The long history of the use of neem in India appears to show that there is a low incidence of side effects when used appropriately. Infants have suffered severe sequelae, and even death as a result of internal use of neem. Avoid using neem products on children.\n\nI don't know about Canada's sellers but you may try Ebay or shopzilla",2

"In the AFC it will come down to the Steelers or Colts. The Colts are fantastic, but the Steelers are as well. Aside from the loss to the Colts and the Patriots by three, the Steelers lost three games due to injuries. Those three games Jaguars, Ravens and Bengals all came down to the final minutes or overtime and all were by 6 points or less and in two of those games Maddox gave up six turnovers. Now they are all healthy and running on momentum. The Colts I'm sure will be ready, but I don't know if they will be flat or not for essentially not playing for a couple of weeks. With Jerome Bettis considering retirement and the superbowl in his hometown I think the Steelers have extra motivation. The defense is playing very well right now too. During the game with the Colts the Steelers lost 26-7, and they should have. But Big Ben's knees were still iffy and he broke his thumb halfway though the game. The Steelers did not run the ball 35 times, only 20 some. When they run the ball 35 times or more they are somehting on the order of 102-2. The Steelers had a chance to score 10 as they missed a field goal and the Colts scored 3 at the very end so there is the possibility that the game could have been 23-10. The Colts got a touchdown very early in the game in which the d-back did not stay with his responsibility. So say that mistake could have made the game 15-10. Aside from another touchdown the Colts scored three field goals. I think both teams are very even and it will be a very close game, something the Steelers have seen but the colts have not.",5

"#3  Joule is a electrical term for 1 watt-second. So it is a power rating.\nOne joule is also: The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt; or one coulomb volt, with the symbol C·V.\n\nAs for why they use it, I think it is a small enough meaurement that 360 joules is much better than 0.1 Kilowatt Hours\n\n2. Varies. There are a few different waveforms that are used by different manufacturers. Each one is based on different resistances.  Honestly, If the Defib is being used for its intended purpose, it should not matter.  This is because either it is a biphasic (newer model) and using the resistance to figure out proper power or Monophasic and usually will increase in power with each shock (most of the times will max out at 3rd shock of 360 joules)  They figure that the resistance is between 25 and 200 ohms with biphasics shocking the equal to 360 joules at 50 ohms (per Medtronic lifepak 500 stat sheet)\n\n1. Again Varies depending on model (this causes part of the wave form in addition to the length of dischage time) But the current overall will change with change in joules.",1

"Hi Rufus\n\nHere is some techniques to heal your condition.\n\nCauses of Sinusitis\n\nOver the course of the last few decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of sinusitis in the U.S. and other industrialized nations that is directly related to a corresponding increase in air pollution and unhealthy indoor air, making unhealthy air and air pollution the two main factors of sinusitis. Other environmental causes of sinusitis include cold and flu viruses, bacterial and fungal infections, excessively cold or dry air, cigarette smoking, and regular exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\nSinusitis can also be caused or exacerbated by food allergies and sensitivities, dental and gum disease, stress, lowered immunity, structural problems within the nasal cavities (such as a deviated septum), nasal cysts and/or polyps, and unresolved emotions, especially anger. Candiasis (systemic yeast overgrowth) and the overuse of pharmaceutical drugs, especially antibiotics, are two other common causes of sinusitis.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatural Cures\nAromatherapy: Inhaling the steamed vapors of the essential oils camphor, eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, pine, or tea tree can help improve breathing and aid in fighting infection. \n\nDiet:If you suffer from sinusitis, you need to be screened for food allergies and sensitivities, and then avoid eating those foods that you are allergic or sensitive to. In addition, avoid all sugar and sugar products, wheat and wheat byproducts, soy products, soft drinks, commercially processed foods, and all foods containing artificial ingredients, such as additives, colorings, flavorings, and preservatives (such as BHA, BHT, sodium nitrite, sulfites, saccharin, aspartame, and cyclamates). Also minimize your intake of milk and dairy products, and coffee and other caffeine products, as well as red meat, salt, refined carbohydrates (white breads, pastries, commercial pastas), corn, chocolate, and unhealthy fats (hydrogenated or trans fats).\n\nDrink plenty of pure, filtered water (at least eight ounces every two hours; or for best results, add fresh squeezed lemon juice and a dash of cayenne pepper) and fresh squeezed, organic vegetable juices throughout the day, as well as hot broths and soups. Diluted organic pear juice can also be helpful, in order to loosen up lung congestion. Also emphasize organic, whole foods, especially plenty of fresh, raw organic fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, organic, free-range meats and poultry, and wild-caught fish. Garlic, cayenne pepper, chili peppers, horseradish, and onions should be eaten regularly, due to their powerful health benefits for the lungs and respiratory system. Organic, extra virgin olive oil should also be used liberally.\n\nAccording to leading naturopathic physician and researcher Joseph E. Pizzorno, N.D., President Emeritus of Bastyr University, a vegan diet can significantly improve symptoms of most respiratory conditions, including pneumonia. Such a diet involves eliminating all animal products, as well as fish, eggs, milk, and all other dairy products. Grains should also be avoided, or eaten in minimal amounts. Dr. Pizzorno advises limiting your fluid intake to pure, filtered water (avoid chlorinated, fluoridated tap water), and emphasize plenty of fresh, organic fruits and vegetables, especially romaine lettuce, carrots, beets, onions, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, cucumber, radishes, Jerusalem artichokes, beans (except soy and green peas), blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, cloudberries, black currants, gooseberries, plums, and pears. Apples and citrus fruits (except lemon) are not recommended, however.\n\nHerbs: Useful herbs for treating and preventing sinusitis include Echinacea, elder flowers, ephedra, eyebright, garlic, goldenrod, goldenseal, horseradish, Oregon grape, pokeroots, purple cornflower, stinging nettle, wild indigo, and yarrow.\n\nHomeopathy:\n\nArsenic",2

Offer whatever support you feel comfortable offering, but also set out clear guidelines regarding what you will and will not do.  You may hurt her feelings, and that's too bad.  But if she thinks she can go through this transition without any hurt feelings, then she is incredibly niave, and hurting her feelings may just be a blessing in disguise.  Just remember, you can hurt somebody's feelings reluctantly or you can do it cruelly.  It sounds to me like you would prefer the former, so be firm, but gentle.\n\nIf she is serious about this, then it is time for her to put on her big girl panties and get to work.  I would not give her chances for survival as a woman much hope if she is not willing to do some very hard work, accept a bunch of disappointment, and deal with quite a bit of rejection.

"Dammit, I used to have a book that told me absolutely everything about Star Trek and the Enterprise. Wish I still had it. I'm sure there is some Trekky website. \n\nI will look. You wait here for someone to give you a real answer.\n\n\nEnergize.\n\n\nI'm back -just like that. Isn't that amazing.\n\nStar dates were among hundreds of unexplained terms thrown into Star Trek by scriptwriters whose main objectives were plausibility, a space-poetical ring, and getting done by deadline.\n\nThe dates in the original show (1966-69) were of the form 0000.0 and were assigned pretty much at random, the producers merely keeping a list to avoid duplication. The numbers meant nothing at first but eventually it was agreed the units were roughly equivalent to earth days and the decimals were tenths thereof.\n\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation things were more systematic. One production staffer was ""keeper of the star dates"" and parceled them out to the episode writers to avoid mixups. The numbers were of the form 40000.0, sometimes with two decimal places. The initial 4 was assigned arbitrarily, the second digit referred to the season, and the remaining three usually progressed from low to high over the course of the season. But everybody was still pretty vague on what the numbers meant in the context of the show.\n\nNot that star dates don't have a rationale. Something of the sort would certainly be required on an actual starship. We know from the theory of relativity that time is local, not universal. When a starship approaches the speed of light, time aboard it slows down from the perspective of us here on earth but continues to hum along at the usual rate for the passengers. Trying to use Earth time aboard the Enterprise would require abruptly speeding up the calendar every time Kirk had Scotty pour on the ions. Better to use ""ship time,"" that is, time as measured on the ship's own clocks. Ship date 1000.5 would mean noon (.5) on day 1000, presumably the thousandth day since the launching of the ship. ""Ship date"" doesn't sound as snappy as ""star date,"" which falsely suggests there is some universal ""star time"" (although see below), but I suppose we can allow for a little dramatic license.\n\nTrouble is, star dates don't follow this logical scheme. During the original series star dates ranged from 1312.4 to 5943.7--a span of 4,600 days, or about twelve and a half years. We know from the opening voiceover that the Enterprise was on a five-year mission. This means either that (1) Kirk and friends were running up some serious overtime, (2) there's more to star dates than meets the eye, or (3) nobody in the show gave the matter a moment's thought.\n\nThe real answer is obvious, but Bjo Trimble's Star Trek Concordance (1976), written with some input from producer Gene Roddenberry, gamely attempts to account for things by saying star dates are ""a function not only of time but of a ship's position in the galaxy and its velocity."" How mere mortals could cope with a timekeeping system of such breathtaking complexity is not explained.\n\nAnother problem is that several episodes in the original series took place only a star date or two apart, even though they seemingly cram in a lot more than 24 hours' worth of action. For example, ""What Little Girls Are Made Of"" begins on 2712.4, ""Miri"" on 2713.5, and ""Dagger of the Mind"" on 2715.1. The Concordance ventures the explanation that ""warp drive distorts time."" This suggests two things: first, star time is universal and not local (in fact the current assumption is that star dates are not peculiar to a given ship but are standard throughout the Federation); and second, inertial (e.g., earth) time would pass more slowly than ship's time, the opposite of what Einstein told us actually occurs. Bjo cheerfully concedes this is a little feeble but says it was the",7

"Also agree that everyone goes too far. Fighting the crowds, the traffic and worrying that you didnt get the right thing or spend enough. And the commercials for shopping give the kids the wrong impression of what the season is about.\n\nEven though they get gifts at Christmas, my children were taught from a young age that it is more important to give than receive. We bake cookies and make candy instead of spending big bucks. We donate to those less fortunate (even though we are struggling ourselves), we 'adopt' a family each year who has nothing and try to help them out. \n\nAnd we spend a special night with our extended family (instead of exchanging gifts). It can be a dinner where everyone gets together for a few hours and talks and laughs, go to see a musical or play, or even plan a game night with all the uncles, aunts, grandparents and cousins. Its always a highlight of the holidays!",0

"speaking personally, i'd love to be able to say that no - marijuana isn't bad for you (because that would make my life easier), but sadly it is.\n\nif you smoke it, it affects your lungs the same way tobacco does - by damaging the small sacs of your lungs that convert the air you breathe to oxygen carriable in your blood.  some doctors think it's worse because when you smoke pot, you tend to hold it in for longer, prolonging the effect of the drug but also causing more damage to your lungs.\n\nwhile you're stoned, your blood pressure drops.  i've fainted a couple of times from this.\n\nalso while you're stoned, your reaction time is slower because your brain takes longer to process information.  this is a direct result of the THC in your system.\n\nand if you smoke pot for a long time? like, years? there are cases of people who are already prone to mental illness having their problems caused/exacerbated by using marijuana.  schizophrenia, paranoid delusions, general paranoia, loss of motivation - these are all potential side effects of long term use.  i've known quite a few people who've been kind of destroyed just from pot.  \n\nand then of course, there's the old argument that using pot leads to using other drugs.  i'm not sure about this, but most people i know who smoke pot also try other stuff.  i mean, a lot of us probably tried it cause we were bored with alcohol, right??\n\nat the end of the day, most things in life are bad for you when you do them to excess.  moderation is the name of the game.  remember that and enjoy a toke or two in peace : )",0

"People saying he can only serve eight years are not exactly correct. If a vice president succeeds to the presidency more than halfway through his predecessor's term, he can seek election twice.

I wouldn't say I was disappointed.  I liked the movie and the story itself.  It didn't make me uncomfortable in any way but that's because I'm actually open minded about this sort of thing and I think everybody should be allowed to love anybody they like whether they're opposite sex or the same sex.  I thought the acting was really good in the movie but the story was slow at times and dragged on. I think Jake Gyllenhaal's character was more 'in love' than Heath Ledger's character.  But there were a few times where I felt really sad for them 'cause they couldn't be together - like that one scene at the lake where Jake's character is really upset they can't see each other.  I'm glad the movie was made.  It definitely shows Hollywood is a bit more open minded these days.  I mean when you think of some foreign movies this subject is not that controversial but for Hollywood it obviously is.  I mean the supposed 'sex scene' wasn't all that bad - at least not as bad as everybody made it seem.  I'm not homophobic so for me it was fine to watch.  And it'll open doors for other small movies with interesting subject matters unlike the same old same old lame Hollywood bullcrap.,7

"Let's see now. Male secretions, a.k.a. semen is made up of about 2–5% spermatozoa and some 60% of the volume is seminal plasma. Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of organic and inorganic constituents including metal and salt ions, sugars, lipids, steroid hormones, enzymes, prostaglandin hormones, amino acids and basic amines such as putrescine, spermine, spermidine and cadaverine. Since the seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract, it has been believed for a long time that the same protective properties can help protect skin from the environment.  The poster jnunz5353 suggests that there is a lot of acid in sperm, the truth is that there area lot of alkalis is sperm. The female reproductive tract if filled with acids, and the alkaline bases in the seminal plasma counteract the acids and protect DNA inside the sperm from acidic denaturation. \n\nAs for it's benefit to skin, Well, semen contains proteins, which tightens the skin helping with wrinkles. It also contains an abundance of natural lipids, essential amino acids and prostaglandin, natural substances which aid in skin repair and increase blood flow bringing in more nutrients to the to the skin. So I would venture to say that it's not bad and may be good. \n\nAs for female fluids, I would venture to say that they probably have little if nay skin health benefits since the vaginal microflora produce lactic acid and acid is not a good thing to ad to the skin unless you are trying to dry it out.",2

"Respiratory therapists and respiratory therapy technicians—also known as respiratory care practitioners—evaluate, treat, and care for patients with breathing or other cardiopulmonary disorders. Practicing under the direction of a physician, respiratory therapists assume primary responsibility for all respiratory care therapeutic treatments and diagnostic procedures, including the supervision of respiratory therapy technicians. Respiratory therapy technicians follow specific, well-defined respiratory care procedures under the direction of respiratory therapists and physicians. In clinical practice, many of the daily duties of therapists and technicians overlap; furthermore, the two have the same education and training requirements. However, therapists generally have greater responsibility than technicians. For example, respiratory therapists will consult with physicians and other health care staff to help develop and modify individual patient care plans. Respiratory therapists also are more likely to provide complex therapy requiring considerable independent judgment, such as caring for patients on life support in intensive-care units of hospitals. In this Handbook statement, the term respiratory therapists includes both respiratory therapists and respiratory therapy technicians.\n\nRespiratory therapists evaluate and treat all types of patients, ranging from premature infants whose lungs are not fully developed to elderly people whose lungs are diseased. Respiratory therapists provide temporary relief to patients with chronic asthma or emphysema, as well as emergency care to patients who are victims of a heart attack, stroke, drowning, or shock.\n\nTo evaluate patients, respiratory therapists interview them, perform limited physical examinations, and conduct diagnostic tests. For example, respiratory therapists test patients’ breathing capacity and determine the concentration of oxygen and other gases in patients’ blood. They also measure patients’ pH, which indicates the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. To evaluate a patient’s lung capacity, respiratory therapists have the patient breathe into an instrument that measures the volume and flow of oxygen during inhalation and exhalation. By comparing the reading with the norm for the patient’s age, height, weight, and sex, respiratory therapists can provide information that helps determine whether the patient has any lung deficiencies. To analyze oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels, therapists draw an arterial blood sample, place it in a blood gas analyzer, and relay the results to a physician, who then may make treatment decisions.\n\nTo treat patients, respiratory therapists use oxygen or oxygen mixtures, chest physiotherapy, and aerosol medications. When a patient has difficulty getting enough oxygen into his or her blood, therapists increase the patient’s concentration of oxygen by placing an oxygen mask or nasal cannula on the patient and set the oxygen flow at the level prescribed by a physician. Therapists also connect patients who cannot breathe on their own to ventilators that deliver pressurized oxygen into the lungs. The therapists insert a tube into the patient’s trachea, or windpipe; connect the tube to the ventilator; and set the rate, volume, and oxygen concentration of the oxygen mixture entering the patient’s lungs.\n\nTherapists perform regular assessments of patients and equipment. If the patient appears to be having difficulty breathing or if the oxygen, carbon dioxide, or pH level of the blood is abnormal, therapists change the ventilator setting according to the doctor’s orders or check the equipment for mechanical problems. In home care, therapists teach patients and their families to use ventilators and other life-support systems. In addition, therapists visit patients several times a month to inspect and clean equipment and to ensure its proper use. Therapists also make emergency visits if equipment problems arise.\n\nRespirator",2

"This is a question in the arenas of philosophy, psycology and sociology - not biology.  But, here's my opinion.  See also Popper and Kuhn (or is it Kuhne?)\nThe publishing process (assuming peer review - this is NOT always the case!) is intended to ask the tough questions about the way the data was obtained.  The peers are experts who have learned (the hard way) many of the pitfalls and errors which can cause errors in the data.  So, before the evidence is published there is usually several reviews of it (again this ignores the problem of prepublication and on-line publishing).  Some of the analysis attempts to be unbiased but some is clearly subjective.  That is, there is more tendency to accept for publication a paper if the author's name Albert Einstein than if it is Joeseph Stalin.  Pedigree is important.  Number of papers published, thesis advisor, number of citations, institutional affiliations, likeableness (really!), personal acquaintance, awards, prestige,and more all play a part.  Also data which confirms the reviewers opinions also has more tendency to be given a cursory review.\nGenerally the peer review process is expected to determine the quality of the data AND the quality of the interpretation, a most daunting task given that generally all that is known is on paper or in a file in front of the reviewer.  No video tapes of the Ah Hah! moment, no printouts of the calibration history, nothing about how the data was ""really"" acquired.  Thats why there is so much emphasis placed on the trust the editor and reviewers have of the author(s).  Thats why PhD diplomas are often a required part of the pedigree.  Error and fraud still slips through.  The recent S Korean stem cell fiasco, and the failure of the Atmospheric and Earth Science community to realize the OBVIOUS fact that data from satellites is biased if orbital decay is not fully accounted for.\nBoth of these failures were at the editorial peer review stage.  BUT!!\nAfter publication the REAL peer review begins.    Scientists are highly opinionated.  Any data contradicting their pet opinions will be (hopefully) subject to intense review.  Character assination, name calling and fist fights also happen, unfortunately.  The process goes as follows.  Paper is read.  Then the data is studied.  Perhaps questions to the author are sent, others are enlisted.  Sometimes more data or raw data is requested.  Visits to labs (if the scientists are still speaking to one another) are scheduled.  Attempts may be made to duplicate the data (not publishable, so IF it is done it is done with MS or undergraduate talent).  Additional experimentation is done based on the scientists analysis of the paper's implications or flaws or both.\nAt the same time Letters may be written to the Journal's Editors if the scientist believes that there is a substantial error in the paper be it in the data or (more often) in the interpretation.  Many times the Letter is a criticism that the author did not take into account other data (did not cite or address it).  Feelings are hurt, careers are made or broken.\nSo, to answer your question:\n1.  Scientists agree on some data - some of which is wrong\n2.  Scientists disagree on data - lots of which is right.\n3.  Scientists often suspend judgement on data (and interpretation) until there is a preponderance of evidence (data) which is consistent with that data (replication and/or confirmation of the same or similar results or additional experiments which rely on (or contradict) the interpretation (falsifiability) presented by the author).\n4.  Motivated scientists work to confirm or contradict the paper's interpretations, depending on which ""side"" they are on.",1

"science is the mechanism which we use to purify generalizations.   the action of science is exactly the replacement of old beliefs with new ones based on incoming evidence, and human determination, and decision, about what is ""fact"".\n but this is only the hard machinery of science, the method, the facilitation of the nature, and the vehicle of the essence of science. i am no prophet, and do not intend to subjectively interpret the universe in the manner of pronouncing some concrete, end-all, answer, so in the spirit of science, let us consider science, make some observations, and stab at some generalizations.\n    while observing science, we humans have come to one of the most startlingly obvious, and startlingly powerful, realizations; that of the principle of natural selection. this principle classically refers to biological evolution, and the ever-present consequences which acts on living things and environments when they interact.\nthe principle more recently has embodied a somewhat more anthropocentric form. richad dawkins [1] was one of the early and explicit proponents of visualizing the effort of natural selection as the ""selfishness"" of genes, and that the driving force of the principle was the expressed selfishness of genes trying to do nothing but replicate themselves, and propagate into the future. the longer that they survive, the more likely it is that they will replicate.  this embodies the cut throat behaviors in nature, as well as the collectivity and cooperativity. this is all very well, and nice, and has been very well recieved in the world of biology  (but not because we are biochauvinists, overly able to relate to something once it is reminicent of human face, but because, the muse of science it the same as the muse of poetry, and imagery enhances scince on a grand scale, so that a better analogies will lead to easier, and better visualization, which will lead to easier and better work). this notion is just precursor to what this question has lead us to. in his book, richard dawkins goes further to introduce the notion of ""memes"" (mee' ms), which are intended to be the analogue of genes, only in the mental realm. they are ideas, tricks, songs, poems, sloagans... truly, anything which can be abstracted, realized, and passed from one mind to another. so that the idea of memes is a meme itself, and it replicated itself from the mind of an author, to my mind, via language, and if  you have not heard of this already, then it has replicated itself again into your mind. very much like genes, memes continue to exist only through replication, and they may mutate as they pass through different minds. yet, unlike genes, a meme can be very sucessful in replication, and yet be very destructive to its host. take for instance, heroin use. it is a learned trick, which has some concrete subjective effect, and yet ultimately has a negative effect on the life of the host, the replication of their genes. for the most part, memes have no regard for genes. this is dangerous for a society which is driven by memes.\n science seems to be the principle of natural selection, but not gene selection in the way of darwin, but a sifting sort of meme selection, acting on a very small class of memes, serving to develop them into the most powerful and planet altering memes that humans have ever seen. because of the power of these things, the careful selection of the memes of scientific principles is very important. the memes which are selected by science are the human interpretations of the principle(s) of the universe. certainly, natural selection existed before it generated the human mind. it was simply left to science to put it into worded interpretation. this did not take very long. not only that, but more than one person came upon the idea, independent of each other. how universal is the action of science then? \n   in a sense, science is a special case of the principle of natural selection, if you g",1
"Hereisyourwayoutofpaydayloans\nPayday debt[how to get out]\nWe first got into the loan because we needed car repairs and didn’t have enough money then someone told us we could get a payday loan.  We went to the payday store and it was so easy just needed to provide a bank statement, pay stub and post dated check for two weeks, my next payday, $575.00 they handed over $500.00 cash.  We really thought we would be able to pay it back and that would be that.  Then when payday came along $575.00 out of it would be hard as we were already living payday to payday.  We went back to the payday store and were told we could just pay the $575.00 cash then re-borrow again that sounded good we just didn’t think of the very high interest rate.  So if you borrow every two weeks at $75.00 interest for 26 weeks that equals $1,950.00 in a year.  So when we would re-borrow that would not  cover all of the bills because we would be short the $150.00 from the interest so we went to the next payday store to cover the monthly bills then we found we needed more money for some other need.  Then when we needed to pay off that loan we were short so we had to go to another to cover that loan then another and another before we knew it we were into four paydays per month.  Here is the calculation $75.00 x 4 loans =$300.00 per two weeks x 26 weeks per year $7,800.00 x 3 years $23.400.00. Paydays are suppose to be a happy time but when you are into them like we were it is a nightmare and very stressful, robbing Peter to pay Paul, running from one store to another. What was amazing is as I was going from one to another I would see the same people at each store, sad but true. \nOur website is    Hereisyourwayoutofpaydayloans",9

"Market capitalization, often abbreviated to market cap, is a business term that refers to the aggregate value of a firm's outstanding common shares. In essence, market capitalization reflects the total value of a firm's equity currently available on the market. This measure differs from equity value to the extent that a firm has outstanding stock options or other securities convertible to common shares. The size and growth of a firm's market capitalization is often one of the critical measurements of a public company's success or failure. However, market capitalization may increase or decrease for reasons unrelated to performance such as acquisitions, divestitures and stock repurchases.\n\nMarket capitalization is the number of common shares multiplied by the current price of those shares. The term capitalization is sometimes used as a synonym of market capitalization; more often, it denotes the total amount of funds used to finance a firm's balance sheet and is calculated as market capitalization plus debt (book or market value) plus preferred stock.\n\nThe total  market capitalization of all the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange is greater than the amount of money in the United States [1]. The global market capitalization for all stock markets was $43.6 trillion in March 2006 [2",6

He told her to photocopy it and he took the original.\nMy advice; if you are in doubt then at the very least photocopy it. Better yet, copy it and if you do not have an officer at school, pass it on to the principal. Because you do not really know for sure then you can let someone else decide. If it is nothing... wonderful! If it is something and you did nothing... not so good.\nLastly, you could flat out ask the kids. Sometimes they aren't so bright about talking. They may flat out tell you that they were just doodling... or that this is their ""symbol."" At least you can put your mind to rest.",3

"A kilogram(Kg) is a measurement of mass.  A newton(N) is a measurement of force.  Think of a mass measurement as measurement of how much stuff there is in an object.  A force measurement is the product of how much stuff there is multiplied by an acceleration of the stuff.  Force equals mass times acceleration.  F= ma.  Think of it this way, imagine you have a bowling ball.  On earth and on the moon, the ball has the same mass(m).  On earth, the ball is heavier because earth's gravity is stronger(gravity is the acceleration in the equation (a)).  Lets assume you have a 1Kg mass.  On earth the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 meters per second squared(m/s^2).  A Kg is therefore 1x9.81= 9.81 Newtons on earth.",1

"The best way is to rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you're only going to read one how-to guide to get to the top of Google, the BEST and most comprehensive resource I found is WebmasterWorld.com's Brett Tabke's advice ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone"" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm\n\nOther ideas:\n\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. PRWeb and my website accepts free press release submissions, among others.\n\n4. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Here is a VERY COMPREHENSIVE list of sites that accept article submissions  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AqmzHU_wN2q8JvMJ6ttE0ewjzKIX?qid=1006022407481 \n\n5. Syndicate your content.

"I would assume we are speaking about the scientific purpose for sexual intercourse.  Of course, humans, having advanced brains, have come up with many purposes for sex. \n\nScientfically, humans procreate through sexual intercourse otherwise known as internal fertilization.  Some animals reproduce using external fertilization, such as frogs.  Other organisms such as bacteria reproduce by copying themselves in a process called budding.  This is much like the cell division in our own bodies.  \n\nThe more complex an organism is the more advanced there reproduction is.  Some animals have many offspring to ensure that their DNA propagates through a population.  In other words, there is safety in numbers.  The less complex an organism's reproduction is the less complex the animal is.  Therfore the animal's offspring has a less chance of survival and reproducing themselves.  This is why some animals have so much offspring and why some only have one offspring.\n\nA parent is not environmentally 'fit' if it's offspring do not reproduce.  The animals that survive and have offspring that reproduce, have the DNA that is 'fit' for their environments.  Why do you think parents are so happy when they become ""grandma"" and ""grandpa""?  They have been successful in their reproduction, or for the purpose of this post,  with their sexual intercourse.  Our survival and 'fitness' is not only dependent on DNA but on our ability to survive in our complex social world, which requires a strong supportive environment.  Scholars cannot agree  about how much DNA and the environment play a role in human survival.  I can assure you though that both are very important.\n\nAs for the evoultionary aspect, any organism has to reproduce in order to propagate in the world.  In order for organsims to reproduce there has to be an inate desire to do so.  This desire is controlled by a number of chemicals in our bodies, many of which are hormones.  Phenotypes (appearance) have also evolved to make humans more sexually attractive to each other, which helps ensure that sexual intercourse will take place.  For example, our loss of hair on our faces and bodies is much more aesthetically pleasing and soft to the touch.  This loss of hair also allows us to see many more facial expressions that convey non-verbal messages more clearly to a would be partner. \n\nThe simplest form of life, which we are said to have originated from, is bacteria-like in nature.  As organsims evolved so did their reproduction.  Internal Fertilization is much more successful than external for the simple reason of it taking place 'indoors'.  \n\nEvolution is change, plain and simple.  This change for humans takes thousands of years, but can be noticed in days or even hours in bacteria.  This is the doctrine of uniformitarianism which is used in geology, but can be applied to other fields of science.  This doctrine states that present processes help to explain the past.  If bacteria can change so quickly and adapt and even resist some things that killed their ancestors, this is clearly a sign of change and hence is called 'evolution'.  What you might ask is because bacteria make an exact copy of themselves so how could they ever change?  Usually bacteria make exact copies, however there are millions and millions of bacteria and every so often there is a random genetic mutation in some of them.  It just so happens that they get lucky because that mutation allows them to survive and pass that trait on to their offspring.    \n\nAll organisms are different.  Humans sexually desire each other and have intercourse for many reasons.  But, scientifically there is one reason and one reason only, Internal fertilization (sexual intercourse) is the most successful and advanced means of reproduction and is a result of trial and error (evolution).  It helps to ensure our propagation through the population.",1

"Erythropoiesis is regulated by erythropoietin, which increases in the presence of hypoxia and regulates RBC production. In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ and the major site of erythropoietin production, so chronic renal failure is associated with anemia. Erythropoietin acts on the marrow in concert with other humoral mediators to increase the number of stem cells entering RBC production, to shorten maturation time, and to cause early release of reticulocytes. Other factors that affect erythropoiesis are the supply of nutrients (eg, iron, folate, or vitamin B12) and cell-cell interactions between erythroid precursors, lymphoid cells, and other components of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Factors that may suppress erythropoiesis include chronic debilitating diseases and endocrine disorders (such as hypothyroidism or hyperestrogenism).",6

"Soap is polarized at one end, and non-polar at the other.\n\nYou know how water and oil don't mix?  That's because water is polar and oil is non-polar.  As a rule, ""Like dissolves like.""  So polar things dissolve in water, non polar things dissolve in oil.  We call polar things ""hydrophilic"" (""water-loving""), while non-polar things can be called either hydrophobic (""water-fearing"") or lipophilic (""oil-loving"").  Since oil and water don't dissolve well in one another, they tend to separate from eachother.\n\nSoap is special because it is hydrophilic at one end and hydrophobic at the other.  This makes it act as a bridge between the two.  Oil gets washed away with soap because the soap molecule will orient itself around little droplets of oil with the hydrophobic end in the oil, leaving the hydrophilic end facing the water.  This allows the water to carry away the small droplets of oil packaged in a coat of soap, and hence cleans you by removing things not normally soluble in water.",1

These are all areas America should surrender to ""La Raza"" once enough immigrants, legal or illegal, enter to claim a majority, as in Los Angeles. The current borders of the United States will  be extinguished.\n\nThe Council of LA RAZA succeeded in having itself added to congressional hearings by Republican House and Senate leaders. And an anonymous senator even gave the Council of La Raza an extra $4 million in earmarked taxpayer money, (supposedly for ""housing reform,"") while La Raza continues to lobby the Senate for virtual open borders and AMNESTY for ILLEGAL ALIENS \nhttp://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=13863\n\n-- Angel Gutierrez, \nProfessor, University of Texas, Arlington- \nFounder of the La Raza Unida political party - \n""We have an aging white America.

"There was a single Sphinx in Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck, according to Hesiod a daughter of Echidna and of Orthrus or, according to others, of Typhon and Echidna — all of these chthonic figures. She was represented in vase-painting and bas-reliefs most often seated upright rather than recumbent, as a winged lion with a woman's head; or she was a woman with the paws, claws and breasts of a lion, a serpent's tail and eagle wings. Hera or Ares sent the Sphinx from her Ethiopian homeland (the Greeks remembered the Sphinx's foreign origin) to Thebes and, in Sophocles Oedipus Tyrannus, asks all passersby history's most famous riddle: ""Which creature in the morning goes on four feet, at noon on two, and in the evening upon three?"" She strangled anyone unable to answer. The word ""sphinx"" comes from the Greek Σφινξ — Sphinx, apparently from the verb σφινγω — sphingo, meaning ""to strangle"". This may be her proper name, but The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology states that her given name was Φιξ — Phix. Oedipus solved the riddle: man — he crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and walks with a cane in old age. Bested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. The exact riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the story and was not standardized as the one given above until much later in Greek history.[2] Thus Oedipus can be recognized as a liminal or ""threshold"" figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the Sphinx, and new, Olympian ones.",3

"The scores on each of the GRE subtests range from 200-800. These scores are called ""standard"" scores and are comparable between the subtests. They have an average of 500 with a standard deviation of 100 (which means that, all things considered, two scores that are less than 100 points apart are not significantly different from one another).\n\nThere are some differences in the ""average"" of each group that takes the test. So there are also percentile rank scores given, which can give you some idea of how you did compared to others who took the test. Percentile ranks range from about 1 to 99. A percentile rank of 83 means that you scored as well or higher than 83 out of 100 students who took the test when you did.\n\nGraduate schools tend to look at the verbal and the quantitative sections, and many don't really know what the analytical section means. Higher scores are generally considered to signal greater likelihood of success in graduate school. Different programs and different degree levels have different expectations for minimum GRE scores. Doctoral programs generally require higher minimum scores than masters programs, competitive schools want higher scores than less competitive schools.\n\nHope this helps.",3

It is well in front of the genitals. \nFurthermore - there is a way with ropes if it's tightened enough it touches nerves and renders the animal unable to move. This used to be done to work on animals on farms before cattle chutes were routine. If it were TIGHT ropes the bull would be unable to move. \nThe strap does not hurt them...it makes them buck higher. That's it. They're bred to buck and bred for attitude.

"There was not an authentic Medieval Code of Chivalry as such - it was a moral system which went beyond rules of combat and introduced the concept of Chivalrous conduct - qualities idealized by knighthood, such as bravery, courtesy, honor, and gallantry toward women. The Medieval Code of Chivalry was understood by all but a Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The idea of the Code of Chivalry were emphasised by the oaths that were sworn in Knighthood ceremonies. These sacred oaths were combined with the ideals of chivalry and with strict rules of etiquette and conduct. The idea and ideals of a Medieval Code of Chivalry was publicised in the poems, ballads, writings and literary works of Medieval authors. The myths of Arthurian Legends featuring King Arthur, Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table further strengthen the idea of a Medieval Code of Chivalry. The Arthurian legend revolves around the Code of Chivalry followed by the Knights of the Round Table - Honour, Honesty, Valour and Loyalty.\n\nThe Song of Roland - Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry\nA Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early 11th Century Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th Century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The duties of a Knight were described as follows:\n\nTo fear God and maintain His Church\nTo serve the liege lord in valour and faith\nTo protect the weak and defenceless\nTo give succour to widows and orphans\nTo refrain from the wanton giving of offence\nTo live by honour and for glory\nTo despise pecuniary reward\nTo fight for the welfare of all\nTo obey those placed in authority\nTo guard the honour of fellow knights\nTo eschew unfairness, meanness and deceit\nTo keep faith\nAt all times to speak the truth\nTo persevere to the end in any enterprise begun\nTo respect the honour of women\nNever to refuse a challenge from an equal\nNever to turn the back upon a foe.\n\nMedieval Code of Chivalry - the Rules of Courtly Love\nThe following rules of Courtly Love were written by the 12th Century Frenchman, Andreas Capellanus. These 31 rules describe the pure romance of love but also describe love for another man's wife. This 'Courtly Love' is illustrated in the fictional story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere. But these rules of Courtly Love led to the downfall and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn, the wife of King Henry VIII - who lived his entire life putting in to practise the 'Rules of Courtly Love'.\n\nI. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.\nII. He who is not jealous cannot love.\nIII. No one can be bound by a double love.\nIV. It is well known that love is always increasing or decreasing.\nV. That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish.\nVI. Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity.\nVII. When one lover dies, a widowhood of two years is required of the survivor.\nVIII. No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons.\nIX. No one can love unless he is impelled by the persuasion of love.\nX. Love is always a stranger in the home of avarice.\nXI. It is not proper to love any woman whom one would be ashamed to seek to marry.\nXII. A true lover does not desire to embrace in love anyone except his beloved.\nXIII.

They don't have any other resort but to make fun of it, belittle it and try to put it down.  Trying to make their own beliefs above the other one keeps them from ever having to expand past their own horizons.\n\nAside from being hurtful, the other downside is that they learn to look beyond themselves and simply never grow as a person or spiritually because they're never really challenged in their faith.  Without a challenege, how do you know how really faithful you are?  And people want the easy way out of everything.  It's human nature.\n\n**As a side note**\nI don't see how she's being hypocritical at all.

"What Does AJAX Stand For?\n\nAJAX means 'Asynchronous Javascript and XML'. Adaptive Path came up with the term in this essay: http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php. However, the word is really a bit of a misnomer: AJAX doesn't really rely on XML at all, but rather on a Javascript function that happens to be named XMLHttpRequest.\n\nAll About XMLHttpRequest.\n\nXMLHttpRequest was originally invented and implemented by a Microsoft team who were working on a webmail application, and it's been around for a while now (since 1999, in fact). The reason it has suddenly come to prominence now is that Google used it in three projects, Gmail, Google Suggest and Google Maps, and in each case managed to create a much better user interface than they would have been able to otherwise.\n\nSo what does XMLHttpRequest do? To put it simply, it lets your Javascript go back to the server, fetch some new content, and write it back out onto the page - all without the user having to change pages. This gives a 'smoother' feel to web applications, as they can do things like submit forms without the whole browser window needing to go blank and reload the page. Take a look at maps.google.com now, and notice how you can drag the map around anywhere you want to go without having to reload the page. This would be unthinkable without XMLHttpRequest.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons XMLHttpRequest has become popular now is that browsers other than Internet Explorer have started to support it, mainly due to the fuss over its use in Gmail. The function is, by all accounts, a very simple one in technical terms: it was just a matter of someone having the idea.\n\nGetting Started with AJAX.\n\nThe first thing to do to get started with AJAX, then, is to create an XMLHttpRequest object in your Javascript code. As ever, Internet Explorer has to be difficult, doing this a different way to every other browser out there. That means that you should use this Javascript code:\n\nvar ajax;\nonload = function () {\n   if (window.ActiveXObject) {\n      ajax = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");\n   }\n   else {\n      ajax = new XMLHttpRequest;\n   }\n}\n\nWhat you've done there is declared ajax as a global variable (usable by all functions), and then created a new AJAX object when the page loads, either using ActiveX for Internet Explorer or the XMLHttpRequest function in other browsers.\n\nThe next step is to write two more functions: one to get data from a URL, and one to handle the data that comes back.\n\nfunction getText(url) {\n   ajax.open(""GET"", url, true);\n   ajax.send(null);\n}\n\najax.onreadystatechange = function () {\n   if (ajax.status == ""200"") {\n   // do things with retrieved text (in ajax.responseText)\n   }\n}\n\nAll you need to do then is call getText from the relevant part of your code with a URL you want to get text from, and put that text wherever you want it to be in the state change function.\n\nThe most powerful thing about this approach is that the URL you send to the server can contain variables, using the old REST (question marks and equals signs) way of doing things.\n\nThat means that, using the code above, you can easily send a request to ajax.php on your server, and include the current value of, say, an input box for a username on a registration form. The ajax.php script checks whether that username is already in use, and then sends either '1' or '0' as its only output. All you would then need to do is check whether ajax.responseText was 1 or 0, and change the page accordingly, preferably using getElementByID.\n\nShould I Use It?\n\nThe question remains over just how useful this is: it's certainly good for some applications where users would otherwise have to submit data over and over again, but it's not much use for smaller ones. AJAX coding has a tendency to take a lot of time, especially the first time you try it, and this is ",4

"The question you have to ask yourself is where you want to be in 5 years versus where you are today. I have seen too many classmates with technology backgrounds focus on MBA courses that emphasize technology. The reason that someone with a technology background should pursue an MBA is to broaden their exposure to other functional areas - in other words you have aspirations to achieve more through increased responsibility and control of resources: people, process, and technology.\n\nAs you have learned through your work experience there is a system/service lifecycle that takes into account a wide variety of considerations (user requirements, cost and schedule constraints, etc.); this is synonymous with what an MBA degree will provide. Translation - It will expose you to other functional elements so that you can better understand your work environment and the decision making process within. It will also provide you with tools to assess the external environment (customers, suppliers, and partners).\n\nAs for going onine, part-time, or through executive courses I would recommend part-time or the executive education for the following reasons. First, you don't give up your current income. Second, you continue to amass experience. Three, you can immediately apply your knowledge (reinforce concepts). Four, your classmates are also working and serves as a great network for future opportunities. If you attend online you get added convenience but at a cost - you lose the classroom interaction (there is a lot to be learned from your fellow classmates in other industries).\n\nI write from actual experience: I have an undergraduate degree in information systems, 11 years of practical work experience, and I'm nearing completion of a part-time MBA program. I found that I could apply principles the day after each course and have found places to apply knowledge every day since. \n\nIf you should pursue a program make sure it is accredited by the AACSB (american) or EQUIS (european).\n\nI hope this helps.",3

"its dominant here extra info\n\n\nHuman height\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n""Stature"" redirects here. For the comic book character, see Stature (comics).\nHuman height, or stature, is the height of a human being. Adult height generally varies little between people compared to other anthropometric measures. Exceptional height (variation from the average of around 20%) is usually due to gigantism or dwarfism. Adult height for one sex in a particular ethnic group follows more or less a Gaussian distribution (bell curve) but with some individuals lying several standard deviations away from the mean. (The tallest well-documented giant was 8 foot 11.1 inches (2.72 m) tall.) Height is determined by the interaction of genes and environment. Final adult height may be attained anywhere from the early teens to early 20s, though it is most commonly reached during the mid teens for females and late teens for males. A person's height also varies over the course of the day, by an average of 19 mm (¾ in), gradually shrinking as the spine compresses over the course of a day, and stretching back out overnight (Tyrrell, et al. 1985).[1]\n\n \nYao Ming is the tallest person in the NBAContents [hide]\n1 Changes in human height \n2 Determinants of growth and height \n3 Process of growth \n4 Height abnormalities \n5 Role of an individual's height \n6 The role of height in sports \n7 Average adult height around the world \n8 References \n8.1 Notes \n9 See also \n10 External links \n \n\n\n[edit] Changes in human height\nThis article or section may contain original research or unverified claims.\nPlease help Wikipedia by adding references. See the talk page for details.\nHuman height is regulated by many factors. Since the development of modern medicine and plentiful nutrient-rich food in the developed world average height has increased dramatically. Nutrition is the most important factor in determining height; and height records from military records and other documents can be used to quite accurately compare nutrition and height in various eras. Evidence has shown that height decreased in Britain in the early nineteenth century, before beginning its long increase around mid-century. Increase in height has not been constant, however. The European Middle Ages was an era of tallness with men of above six feet (1.83 m) considered unremarkable. In Europe human height reached its nadir at the start of the nineteenth century. Until the general rise in human health, as urbanization increased, the accompanying trend was a height decline.\n\nEuropeans in North America were far taller than those in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in fact the tallest in the world. The original indigenous population was also among the tallest populations of the world at the time. However, several nations, indeed many nations in Europe, have now surpassed the US in terms of average stature, particularly the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian nations. Most markedly is the Netherlands where average height has increased at the greatest rates. For instance: the Netherlands was in the late nineteenth century a land renowned for its short population, but today it has the tallest average in the world [1], with young men averaging 1.83 m (6 ft) tall and only shorter than the peoples of the Dinaric Alps, where males average 1.856 m(6ft 1.08 in) tall. The Dutch are now well known in Europe for extreme tallness. The increase has been so dramatic that various things have been redesigned to fit the much taller frames. In contrast, average male height in impoverished Vietnam and North Korea[2] remains comparatively small at 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) and 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m) respectively. Currently, young North Korean males are actually significantly shorter. This contrasts greatly with the extreme growth occurring in surrounding Asian populations with correlated increasing standards of living. Young South Koreans are about 3 i",1

"I have a very similar situation happening to me in August as well, only i am not as fortunate because my girlfriend is moving across the country, whereby i will not be able to see her nearly as often. My plan consists of keeping the romance alive.  I will never bring up any issues, and i will never allow myself or her to go to bed upset/mad. (these are in case there are any problems.)  Other things i will do is to visit her as often as i can, talk to her on the phone whenever her schedule will allow me to (i will make time and sacrifice my own schedule just to talk to her) even if it is only to say ""hello, i love you, goodbye."" I will e-mail her, and send her e-cards, poems that i have written, just little reminders that i love and am thinking of her.  I will send her letters randomly, so that she never knows when to expect the next one (allows for some surprise), and i will randomly send gifts and flowers for no reason at all.  Sometimes, i will just show up without telling her (surprise again).  I have a good many other ideas that i could share, if you would like, but i will leave you with my most important idea to keep it alive: I will trust her completely.  I will never allow myself to become jealous or untrusting because she really does not need that; college will be stressful enough without me adding to that burden.  I will let her grow as a person, adapt to her, and be her ""backbone"" in all decisions which she chooses; i will support her and be there for her. This i believe is truly important.

"In the late part of the 18th century and early part of the 19th century attempts were made to make both the trumpet and bugle into chromatic instruments.  One such attempt was the slide trumpet.  Some historians attribute the invention to England.  A French version appears around 1840.  A description of the instrument follows:\n\n""It was basically the natural trumpet of its period except that the bend joining the middle pipe and the bellpipe was made in the form of a U-slide which could be pushed out towards the player by means of a rod with a touch-piece lying under the second and third fingers of the right hand and automatically closed again by a spring.""\nAnother early attempt was the keyed trumpet and keyed bugle. The keyed trumpet is about 40 centimeters long and is held in a horizontal plane. The best way to think of these instruments is as almost a hybrid of a saxophone and a natural trumpet.  There are a number of keys (between five and nine) placed around the instrument and the pitch is raised or lowered by opening any combination.  The tone is produced with a metal mouthpiece as with any other brass horn.  Both Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) and Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) wrote concertos for the keyed trumpet and their works were the hallmarks of the literature for the trumpet.  The invention of the keyed trumpet is attributed to Anton Weidinger of Vienna in 1801.  Weidinger was a court trumpeter who was employed as a military trumpeter and theater musician, for whom Haydn wrote his concerto.\nThe keyed bugle was essentially the same as the keyed trumpet but with the bugle's distinctive conical shape.  The keyed bugle was made originally in England and became known to the public through the works of Richard Willis (17?-1830), an arranger, composer and performer.  The first patent was made by Joseph Halliday (dates unknown) in 1811.  Halliday named his new instrument the Royal Kent bugle in honor of the Duke of Kent.  His patent called for five keys and the instrument made its way to the United States with Willis when he was appointed bandmaster of the United States Military Academy Band at West Point, New York.\nTwo performers on the keyed bugle worth mentioning are Francis Johnson (1792-1844) and Edward (Ned) Kendall (1808-1861).  Johnson was a talented black bandleader who played many instruments including the keyed bugle.  He also composed music for his band which played for parades, military drills, and balls in Philadelphia.  One of his compositions was The Bugle Quickstep, no doubt written with the instrument in mind.  The most important keyed bugle performer in the United States was Ned Kendall.  He started performing on the instrument around 1830, continuing the work begun by Willis.  Kendall perfected greater skill in playing and helped spread the popularity of the keyed bugle.  His solo skills were in high demand and he performed widely with a leading vocalist of the time, Miss Anna Stone.  Another performer on the keyed bugle was the bugler at West Point, Louis Benz, who was the post bugler for forty years from 1830-1870.  Photographs survive of Benz with keyed bugles.\n  \n \n Around the 1840s, while the keyed bugle was still popular, the development of valved brass instruments began to appear in the United States. This was the next step in making the trumpet and bugle chromatic instruments, and the development is highlighted in the story of the virtuoso instrumental piece called Wood Up Quickstep, composed in 1835 by John Holloway (dates unknown).  Many tales of the origin of the piece exist but according to Holloway it came to him while walking on the Common in Boston.  The piece became closely associated with Ned Kendall.  Despite the invention of the valved cornet, Kendall continued to play the keyed bugle all his life.  He took part in a famous contest with himself on the keyed bugle, playing against Patrick Gilmore on the valved cornet in December of 1856 in Salem, MA.  The cont",7

"Maybe.  It's feasible if 1) you like HOW they market, 2) you follow their process.  The critical part of any MLM is to get people to do the same thing over and over again.  This usually means there are a lot of rallys and sometimes inauthentic pep talks.  What's happening is people are replacing what large corporations have to pay to accomplish.  So, if I were Nestle, I'd have a very large marketing and advertisiting budget to tell people to buy Nestle Hot Chocolate.  But, if I'm Stevens, I get a bunch of people to tell their friends and family tht this is the best hot chocolate made in the world.  If I were to trade my time to do that, I'd get paid for that.  I'd also get paid for anyone else I've gotten to do that with me.  \n\nSo, it makes sense.  It works, if you work it.  What are the drawbacks?  I've looked into a few, and found that I can't keep my dignity and do these things.  I am a thinking person, and thinking is not allowed with these groups.  They want you to follow the formula, kind of like a drone in a bee hive. \n\nAlso, a lot of these groups don't have a lot of credibility.  Face it, you hang out with a lot of people that are kind of like you.  In an MLM, a lot of people aren't like you.  When you bring people like you to meet with people not like you, they wonder if you're like them.  In a typical business arrangement, Nordstrom shoppers don't mix with thrift store shoppers, and so nobody questions whether the store can meet their needs.  MLMs mix up the people in a way that favors people who believe in the lottery, but don't invest in their own education.  \n\nLast thought: I know a lot of dignified and successful people who have worked in MLMs.  Some of these have incredible wealth, and they did it on the merits of their labor, not on anything else.  It's a way to level the playing field.  \n\nWhatever you decide, good luck",6

"The origin of billiards will probably never be exactly pinpointed. While it may have sprung from earlier games played with balls on a table in China, Italy, or Spain, the best guess is that it originated in France as an indoor version of a lawn game similar to croquet. (On the other hand, some historians have suggested that croquet originated as an outdoor version of billiards.)\nThe name almost certainly comes from the French billart, the stick that was used, and that word probably comes from bille, meaning ""ball."" When first recorded, in the 15th century, the object of the game was to push a ball through a croquet-like wicket to hit a peg, similar to the stake in croquet. Players used a club-like stick, which became known as the ""mace"" in England.\nWhen the ball was up against a rail, however, the head of the mace was too unwieldy and the other, narrower end of the stick was used. This was called the ""queue,"" meaning tail--hence the modern word, cue.\nShakespeare refers to billiards in Antony and Cleopatra--which led one early sports historian to conclude that it was an old Egyptian sport--and by 1675 it was very popular in England. The first known rule book was published that year, and its writer claimed that there were ""few Towns of note therein which hath not a publick Billiard-Table.""\nThe first steps toward making billiards a ""scientific"" sport were taken by a Frenchman, known only as Captain Mingaud, who was a political prisoner in Paris during the French Revolution. While in prison, he enjoyed playing billiards so much that he refused to be released when his time was up.\nMingaud discovered that, if he rounded the cue tip with a file, he could aim more accurately. He also added a leather tip to further improve control of the ball. After finally leaving prison, Mingaud traveled around France giving exhibitions and stirring a great deal of interest in the sport.\nThe leather tip lost its effectiveness when it became shiny with use and had to be replaced frequently. An English billiards teacher, Jack Carr, learned that putting chalk on the tip prevented miscues. He was also evidently the first player to hit the ball off-center to apply spin.\nCarr was a genuine hustler. He traveled around Europe during the 1820s, giving his demonstrations and selling his magical ""twisting chalk"" at an exorbitant price, throwing in a free lesson on how to make it work. As a result, the term ""English"" entered the lexicon of billiards--although, ironically, it's called ""side"" in England.\nBy that time, there were several different versions of billiards. In France, the most popular game was carom billiards, played with three balls (occasionally four balls) on a pocketless table. As in modern billiards, the object was to hit both of the object balls with the cue ball--called a carom or a billiard.\nThe most common game in England was also played with three balls, but on a table with six pockets. There were two ways of scoring: By pocketing a ball (other than the cue ball) or by hitting both of the other balls with the cue ball. This game is the ancestor of modern pocket billiards and English snooker..☺",5

"The answer to this question is the Fifth Ammendment to the United States Constitution. You, as a citizen or resident of the U.S.,  have the right to be free from self-incrimination. However, law enforcement has the right to conduct criminal investigations regardles of whether the suspect is a minor or an adult. I'm sure you've heard on TV, ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used as evidence against you in criminal proceedings."" This is a mandatory statement used by law enforcement officers to allow a criminal suspect to know that he is a suspect, but he does not have to answer questions or make statements that would incriminate himself. The only difference when it comes to interviewing minors is that they have the right to have a parent or legal guardian present during any questioning. Furthermore, law enforcement officers may not threaten or coerce information form a suspect. In other words, if I beat you for three hours while you were wearing handcuffs, locked in a 95 degree room, and hungry and thirsty, I would have you confessing to Kennedy's assassination, which we can all deduce is probably not true. Statements made from coercion or threats are not admissible in criminal courts. As law enforcement officers, we can ask anything we want to receive the information we need, so long as we don't physically or mentally harm someone. But the Fifth Ammendment says you don't have to answer. Hope this helps.",3

"Men have superegos, they are bruised easily by females. Men feel that they should be able to do what they want, but that you shouldn't say anything about their behavior.

They are wrong, a couple needs to be able to talk, communicate or there is definitely a problem. As for lying, lying is a way they can feel in control, have everything go their way. They know the risks of lying to you, but they still do it because it's a defense mechanism, it keeps them from having to face their fears. Don't let them do you like that though, regardless if they are scared of commitment or being open with their mate, you can't sit back and be second.

"premature ejaculation.  if it is not used alot he may become stimulated too fast.  if he would like to prolong the use of his love pole, he needs to use it more and practice long stimulation.\n\nPremature ejaculation, also known as rapid ejaculation, or by the Latin term ejaculatio praecox, is the most common sexual problem in men, characterized by a lack of voluntary control over ejaculation. Masters and Johnson stated that a man suffers from premature ejaculation if he ejaculates before his partner achieves orgasm in more than fifty percent of his sexual encounters. Other sex researchers have defined premature ejaculation as occurring if the man ejaculates within two minutes of penetration; however, a survey by Alfred Kinsey in the 1950s demonstrated that three quarters of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration in over half of their sexual encounters. Today, most sex therapists understand premature ejaculation as occurring when a lack of ejaculatory control interferes with sexual or emotional well-being in one or both partners. An estimated thirty percent of men suffer from premature ejaculation on a consistent basis.",8

"Use the Following Method of Penis Enlargment rather than Pills.\n\nPenis exercises works on the basis of exercising the muscle structures of the penis know as corpus canvernosum, which makes up 2/3 of the penis. Your current penis size is determined by the maximum amount of blood that your corpus cavernosa can hold when you have an erection. With proper exercise, the corpus cavernosa can be developed to be larger and stronger so that it will be able to hold more blood, giving you an increase in penis size.\nThe corpora cavernosa, is a spongy tissue containing distensible blood spaces, which increases in size when blood is pumped into it. And it is similar in construction to the pore cells in marine life called sponges. When the the pore cells in a live sponge are stretched repeatedly, it's absorption pores will expand and heal in this expanded state. Thus, the pore cells will become larger and more capable of absorbing more water and nutrients.\nThe corpora cavernosa is a live tissue which responds similarly in the manner of a sponge. Therefore, the actual size of the erectile tissue will increase as the distensible blood spaces increase their ability to absorb more blood, under the continuous stretching and healing of exercises. Thus, a larger penis can be achieved via exercises",2

You could put the in an insulated constainer with cold packs but make sure there is separation between the medication and the ice packs.  You need to inulate the medication so that it does not freeze.  Ideally you would get a device that plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car that has a controlled temperature at refridgerator levels.

"Welfare is financial assistance paid by the government to certain entities or groups of people who are unable to support themselves alone, or are perceived by the government to be able to function more effectively with financial assistance. Some welfare is general, while some are specific and can only be invoked under certain circumstances, such as a scholarship. Welfare can be given to both individuals, or be given to companies or entities, which take place as corporate welfare.\n\nReasons for individuals being unable to support themselves alone might be unemployment, disability, lack of education or some other reason. Assistance may also take form of other relief, such as tax credits for working mothers. Welfare is known by a variety of names in different countries, all with the fundamental purpose of providing an economic or social safety net for disadvantaged members of society. Almost all developed nations provide some kind of safety net of this kind; the governments of those nations where this is especially prominent are known as welfare states.\n\nThe desired outcome and purpose of welfare varies. For individual welfare for the non-disabled, the purpose of welfare often is to provide those who require financial assistance in order to attain a higher income in the first place, especially for those who are perceived to be stuck in the cycle of poverty. The justification for financial assistance to such individuals often cites the requirement for existing financial resources in order to attain tertiary education that would allow individuals to gain more income, and thereby get out of welfare eventually. Welfare for the disabled, in contrast, does not eventually expect non-dependency, and the justification is more philosophical. Welfare may be given to entities as corporate welfare in order to provide capita to industry are perceived by the government to need financial assistance in order to survive or to expand but are thought by the government to be valuable industries eventually and will eventually become non-dependent.\n\nSome of these ideal outcomes and purposes, as well as welfare's effectiveness have been challenged by political lobbies such as those who oppose big government, such as minarchists or libertarians.\n\nPersonal Welfare:\nThe amounts paid to individuals are typically very low, and may fall below the poverty line. Recipients must usually demonstrate a low level of income such as by way of ""means testing"", or financial hardship, or that they satisfy some other requirement such as childcare responsibilities or disability. Those receiving unemployment benefits may also have to regularly demonstrate that they are periodically searching for employment. Some countries assign specific jobs to recipients who must work in these roles in order for welfare payments to continue. In the United States and Canada, such programs are known as workfare.",9

"First priority: WISEDOM in the LEADERSHIP of USA, UK, France ,Germany and Russia about war and armament, far far greater than what we have now.  Wisdom of the Churchill/Roosevelt or Reagan/Thatcher level or above.\n\nYou need to pick a recipient who will TAKE all the nuclear arms, oh, say, the Queen of England.  Pick the wrong recipient and this whole idea is a FIASCO.  Pick the wrong organization (like the UN, a whorehouse for the world's remaining dictators and despots) and nothing good will happen, either.\n\nYou need to get her to agree and come up with a central location for them, like the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea.  Then you need to get the governments of the world to agree to disarm and ship them there.  This will take 30 to 50 years.  The wise leader may have to threaten the last two or three holdouts, who will be dictators, in order to get them to cough up their nukes.\n\nOnce they are all in one place, they can be placed on a destruction schedule by the wise leader who won't abuse them or use them to threaten others.  the destruction will take 10 to 20 years.\n\neliminate nuclear energy by coming up with something superbly more efficient and less expensive -- ""research"" is the answer to this question, and not the kind of political throw-away junk research the US Department of Energy has blown billions and billions on since it was stupidly founded by Jerry Ford 30 years ago.",9

"As a former assistant pastor, I have seen this type of dillemma, before. The problem is that most medium to large churches have become a source of entertainment, rather than inspiration. \n\nIt sounds like this church has a youth group of several dozen kids. They probably have a youth pastor for Wednesday night youth group, and a volunteer young adult to teach SS. This volunteer sounds like being seen as cool is more important to him than inspiring the kids to be moral.\n\nWhenever you frequent a place with large numbers of people you will find small groups of people that become the true source of inspiration, whether for good or evil. People cannot grow spiritually when they are simply members of an audience. We need companionship and friendship, a hand to hold, a shoulder to cry on. We will be naturally drawn to those we feel are most likely to accept us.\n\nThe problem is not one person, it is the entire empire of Christianity we have built in America. Jesus chose twelve disciples. These twelve were the ones he poured himself into. The common bond of this group was love. Yet, even among these twelve, one became a traitor. Can you imagine how many Judas could have influenced if he had his own SS class?\n\nThe problem is extremely complex, but the answer is simple. Find a few families that have children close to the ages of yours. Meet with them at your house, their house, the coffee house. Study with them, pray with them, talk with them. Don't try to start a class, just be friends. Have a BBQ together, go to the lake together, watch the game together. In other words; make friends, and let them be your support group. \n\nIf you want to attend a church on Sunday morning, fine. But, don't let that be the sole source of inspiration for your family. Jesus called his disciples ""friends""; not students, congregants, or members. You need a small group of like-minded families sharing the love of God, and the  journey of life, together.",0

"The first part of the US-Canada border was first defined in 1783 with  the Treaty of Paris, that marked the border between the new United States of America from British colonies in North America. Because the area was not well mapped, there were some disputes, and minor skirmishes, until the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842 which fixed the border between Maine and New Bruinswick. As both the US and British-run Canada were exanding westward in the 1840's, there was another dispute on where the US-Canada border would exist in the western part of the continent. The Americans wanted to claim everything south of the parallel of latitude of 54' degrees 40 minutes. (leading to the phrase 54-40 or fight!). In 1846, the Oregon Territory treaty was passed, setting the US-Canada border as a continuation of the 49th parallel (where it was set along the Minnesota border).

You are wrong onmany points and i will focus on 2 of them.\n\n1) You stated: ""The United States has been attacked multiple times by terrorists with increasing intensity. It is the job of the federal government to ensure that such attacks come to an end.""\n\n*You imply here that the US is the victim and that it needs to carry out its wars in Iraq & Afganistan both as a response to 911 (& other attacks) and as a way to prevent such attacks in the future. This is wrong. Attacking other countries will only inflames tensions and create more ""terrorism"". My claim is back by a CIA report to the Senate Foreign Relations Commitee last year in which the CIA itself has said that the war in Iraq has increased anymosity toward the US & increased the number of terror attack worldwide. In addtion, you have to realize that is was the US that created this problem in the first place. Starting in 1953 with the over throw of DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED Prime Minister Mohamed Mossadegh to install a BRUTAL dictator that killed, raped, and torutred Iranians. ALL IRAINIANS REMEMBER THIS.\nthe way to end terrorism is to get out of Iraq & Afganistan now and stop meedling in other countries affairs! \n\n2) You WRONGFULLY state: ""It has proceeded down this path with restraint.

I actually would recommend doing something like this in Fireworks or Photoshop, but if you don't have the budget for those higher end products, I wouldn't worry too much..  For now, I'll go with Word since everyone has that.\n\nI'm not sure what your making your e-flyer for, so that's pretty much your part.  Set up it up however you'd like with pictures, your bio, your service list, contact info, etc.  Whatever you'd like.  The trick will be getting people to see the e-flyer.  I would go about it two ways.  Create a .pdf file, and publish it to a web site and distribute the web address to potential clients (if you're a service based business).  To create a pdf, I'd download a program called CutePDF.\nhttp://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp\nIt'll allow you to save it as a small file format, and most users wont be able to edit it.  You can also save your file in Word as an HTML document that is automatically ready to be uploaded to a server on the web.  If you don't have a domain name, I beleive you can get free ones at places like Yahoo! or GeoCities (like me.yahoohomepage.com, etc.).\n\nOne other thing, when you're done, I'd screen capture the .pdf (by pressing the PRTSC button on the top right hand part of the keyboard), import the picture into Paint and edit out your desktop, and save the file as a .jpg file that you can insert into emails and send out.

"The Flesch-Kincaid Readability Tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a reading passage is to understand. There are two tests, the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Although they supposedly use the same measures, just placed into a different scale, the results of the two tests do not always correlate (a text with a better score on the Reading Ease test over another text may end up with a worse score on the Grade Level test.)\n\nFlesch-Kincaid Grade Level\nAn obvious use for readability tests is in the field of education. The ""Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula"" translates the 0-100 score to a U.S. grade level, making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts. \n\nThe result is a number that corresponds with a grade level. For example, a score of 6.1 would indicate that the text is understandable by an average student in 6th grade.",3

"I am starting my 4th year of Medical School at UT San Antonio in Texas.  I am lucky because Texas offers its residents the least expensive medical school in the US with tuition and fees of about 11K to 12 K per year.  Books, living expenses, etc...all add up of course, but the federal student loan program allows anyone who is willing to live frugally (my budget for living expenses on loans only is about 1500 per month and this is not difficult to do) the ability to borrow all that is necessary to pay for school and live.  You will be borrowing probably 150K over the 4 years, but you can consolidate and pay it back over long enough that it is do-able if you really want to do it.  \n\nAnother option is the military program.  Any branch of the military offers a stipend that will basically give you the same amount of money that loans do per month, pay for tuition, fees and books and in exchange you will pay back year for year to the military.  So, you will not be in any debt at all when you complete your time committment to the military.  They are recruiting strongly now and allow many things, such as older than usual or past medical histories of some things, that they would not have allowed in the past.  This is a good option if you are not comfortable with debt.\n\nAs for how difficult it is to get in my advice is this.  When I decided to apply some people laughed at me and said I would never make it because I was a fine arts major and went to a smaller, less than impressive undergraduate school, but I DID get in and if you really want to - you will too.  Check the school web sites for necessary prerequisites and time lines to apply, do some volunteer work or work as an orderly or something like that in a hospital - this will prove that you are motivated, and then take the MCAT entrance exam (I HIGHLY recommend a preparation course prior to taking this exam - they are MORE than worth the money).  Apply - if you don't get in the first try - go in person to talk with someone in the admissions department at a medical school and talk with them openly about your application.  Take their advice and re-apply.  We need good doctors.  So, if you feel the calling, don't let anything get in your way!",3

"Probably not.\n\nAt the moment the laws of physics show the speed of light is an absolute barrier for matter. It is not like the speed of sound which was an engineering hurtle, crossing or attain the speed of light is impossible for anything with mass.\n\nIn a particle accelerators the electrons, protons and whatnot can be moved to speeds very close to that of light (like 99%), but they never reach the speed of light.\n\nIf you're in a rocket and turn up the motor you can get closer and closer to the speed of light...but never reach it.\n\nCertainly in the future we will have a better understanding of physics, but it is exceedingly unlikely that something as fundamental as the speed of light barrier will be shown to be wrong. (Just as when Einstein came out with General Relativity - which is essentially a theory of gravity - it did not show that Newton's Theory of Gravity was wrong so much as it only applied to (relatively) small masses.)\n\nAs for the galaxy, those above are correct that it is not expanding. Rotating, but not expanding.\n\nThe universe itself is expanding, and finding over the last few years have found that the rate of expansion is accelerating. Meaning that that in the future the universe will expand faster. Eventually something bad will happen if that acceleration keeps going. But that's in 100 billion years or so, so I wouldn't worry.",1

Since nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, an nitrogen bonded to a hydrogen is a very polar bond with the positive end of the dipole at the hydrogen. So the positive hydrogen of one molecule will be attracted to the negative nitrogen of another. This makes it harder to separate molecules of CH3CH2CH2NH2 into the vapor phase, so the boiling point is higher.",1

If you don't get pregnant this month, you may want to test next month with a predictor that gives you a day or two advanced notice. If I find the exact speed for sperm I'll modify my answer to give you a more exact idea. Good luck.",2

"The only way the stock market would crash again is if everyone borrows money from banks to invest in stocks and never pay the money back. For example buyer A borrows money from the bank and buys stock. buyer A then sells his stock, that he has earned profit off of, to buyer B. buyer B has borrowed money from the bank to purchase from buyer A. buyer b then takes that stock and sells back to buyer A. Buyer A then has borrowed money from the bank to afford the price of the stock buyer B has asked for. this goes on and on, borrowing money from the banks and niether of the buyers has payed the banks back which makes the banks go into default and this results in a stock market crash. so as long as people do not borrow too much money and pay back their loans, we should not have to worry about a depression.

"Everyone says that The surface tension causes the drop to be spherical. But how? and Why?\n\nLets explain surface tension first-\nIn an air-water interface, the molecules that are close to the surface are attracted by fewer molecules of the liquid than the ones that are NOT close to the surface. The former thus, has less attractive potential energy than the latter, right?\n\nNow, for any matter (solid or liquid), attractive potential energy results in stability & repulsive energy results in instablity. Right?\n\nSo, it is energetically unfavourable to have a surface for a liquid (or solid) as it results in loss of attractive potential energy.\n\nNow, for that reason, a drop tends to have the lowest possible surface area to remain stable. Now, using some high level mathematics, we can find out that a sphere has the lowest possible surface area for a given volume. (it is better than a cube atleast).\n\nHence why we can see that the water bubbles and drops tend to be spherical. \n\nBUT, as gravity pulls the drop downwards, it looks like the way it does. Due to the distortion by the pull of gravity, the drops appear somewhat oval in shape but, in the absense of gravity, all the liguid-air surfaces tend to be spherical.\n\nI hope it helped.\nHave a nice day!",1

"Neurofibromatosis(Von Recklinhausen disease)(NF)\n\n\nWhat is NF? You ask. Neurofibromatosis, pronounced Neuro-fi-bro-ma-to-sis, (NF for short), is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that causes tumors to form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. This progressive disorder affects all races, all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. NF is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States, (one in every 3,000 to 4,000 births), even though not many people are familiar with it. There are two genetically distinct forms of NF, NF-1 and NF-2. The effects of NF are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. \n\nThere is no known cure for either form of NF, even though the gene for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF has no treatment other than the surgical removal of tumors which may some times grow back. \nNF is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, meaning you can not catch it from other people. Only 50% of those affected with NF have a prior family history of NF. If an individual does not have NF he/she can not pass it on to his/her children. NF is classified as a disease. Disease is so negative. NF is not contagious.",2

"I think that compared to when my grandparents were young kids now a days are more lazy and more rude. We do not make our children (well some of us do not) get up at 4am to milk cows & get eggs from chickens,come home from school and do school work. We do whip our children (not that everyone did that either then) for mis speaking. But honestly we do not have to whip our children for them to behave. Our children our the way they are partly on how we allowed them to be raise, by our own examples in everyday life from how we speak to the sales person at marshals or walmart, how we talk to the cashire, how we treat a waitor or waitress who screws up an order or takes to long getting to you. Kids mimic everything from how we act when we cook, to how we are in thecar when traffic is jammed, lost, or an idiot driving. they mimic our phone conversations and us getting mad at applkiences and electronics. they even try and mimic our dress and music at times. As well as what they hear or see on tv, radio, games and computure,and yes even in public. so compared to the 80s are kids more rude I am not 100% sure but it seems they get a way with a lot more crude sayings and behaviour partly because we allow it and also they more swearing is allowed on tv and radio as well as humor that was not okay back then but is ok now.",0
"A glide bomb is an aerial bomb that is modified with aerodynamic surfaces to modify its flight path from a purely ballistic one, to a flatter, gliding, one. This extends the range between the launch aircraft and the target. Glide bombs are often fitted with control systems, allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target.\n\nThe first glide bombs were developed by the Germans during World War II as an anti-shipping weapon. Ships are typically very difficult to attack: a direct hit is needed to do any serious damage, and hitting a target as small as a ship was difficult during WWII. The US felt the solution was massive fleets of bombers dropping a huge numbers of bombs, leading to the development of the B-17, but the Germans instead concentrated on making the bombing itself much more accurate. At first they used dive bombers with some success in this role, but their successes were countered by ever increasing anti-aircraft defenses placed on the Royal Navy ships they were attacking. By 1941 such attacks were still just as difficult as ever, but the added defenses made such attacks almost suicidal as well.\n\nThe German solution was the development of a number of radio controlled glide bombs. These were constructed by fitting a control package on the rear of an otherwise standard bomb, starting with their 100kg armor-piercing bomb to create the Ruhrstahl SD 1400, commonly referred to as the Fritz-X. The bomb aimer dropped the bomb while the aircraft was still approaching the ship, and guided it into an impact with the target by sending commands to spoilers attached to the rear of the bomb. This proved to be difficult to do, because as the bomb dropped toward the target it fell further behind the launch aircraft, eventually becoming difficult to see. In addition it proved difficult to properly guide the bomb to impact as the angle of descent changed, and if the bombadier didn't ""get it right"" and end up with the bomb roughly right over the target, there was little they could do at late stages to fix the problem.\n\nNevertheless the Fritz X proved useful once crews were trained on its use. In test drops from 8000m, experienced bomb aimers could place half the bombs within a 15m radius and 90% within 30m. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Germany damaged the Italian battleship Italia and sank the Roma with Fritz X bombs. Attacks were also made on the USS Savannah, causing heavy damage, and on several transports off Anzio. HMS Warspite was also hit, had to be towed to Malta and was out of action for six months. Fritz X attacks also damaged the cruiser USS Philadelphia and sank the British light cruiser Spartan.\n\nA more useful weapon was the Henschel Hs 293, which fitted a set of small wings to the guidance system to flatten the trajectory and make the system easier to guide. On release a small liquid fueled rocket fired to speed up the weapon and get it out in front of the bomber, which was aimed to approach the target just off to one side. The bomb then dropped close to the water and glided in parallel to the launch aircraft, with the bomb aimer adjusting the flight left or right. As long as the bomb was dropped at roughly the right range so it didn't run out of altitude while gliding in, the system was easy to use.\n\nDesign work started as early as 1939, and a version of the guidance package mounted to standard 500kg bombs was tested in September 1940. It was found that the bomb was unable to penetrate a ships armor, so changes were made to fit an armor-piercing warhead before the system finally entered service in 1943. The basic A-1 model was the only one to be produced in any number, but developments included the B model with a custom armor-piercing warhead, and the C model with the conical warhead that was designed to hit the water short of the ship and then travel a short distance underwater to hit the ship under the waterline.\n\nThe Hs 293 was first used operationally",9

"because when the vikings compared it to iceland it was green\nit is a relative measure\nThe name Greenland comes from Scandinavian settlers. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. He, along with his extended family and thralls, set out in ships to find the land that was rumored to be to the northwest. After settling there, he named the land Grønland (""Greenland""), possibly in order to attract more people to settle there. Greenland was also called Gruntland (""Ground-land"") on early maps. Whether Green is an erroneous transcription of Grunt (""Ground""), which refers to shallow bays, or vice versa, is not known. It should also be noted, however, that the southern portion of Greenland (not covered by glacier) is indeed very green in the summer, and the area likely had even more green vegetation in the Medieval warm period when the name was given.",1
"I work as the network administrator for a school district in Virginia. It would appear that you are confused about different network security devices.

Another approach is to inform the waitstaff who shows you to your table or to excuse yourself for the restroom & tell the server while you are away. In most of these situations it is an easy thing to do even if other people are around.\n\nAnother thing my friend does is that he will normally jump in to order first when he's decided that he's treating us. It can be quite funny to watch he & my husband if they've both decided to treat on the same night.

"I would like to throw in my two cents to this question. First, in order for actin and myosin to attract, calcium is required. Where does it come from? Well to start a muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter ach must be present at the myoneural junction. Now an action potential will travel down the t-tubules and open gates that allows calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The calcium stored there simply diffuses down its own concentration gradient. Now for the muscle to relax the calcium must be re-stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, now it is against its concentration gradient, and it takes ATP energy to put it back. So to answer your question it takes ATP energy to cause muscle contraction and it takes ATP energy to cause muscles to relax. In fact as ATP stores deplete, it takes muscles a longer period of time to relax. I have actually measured this.",1

"The Navajo Nation\nThe largest U.S. Indian tribe, the Navajo Nation consists of more than 298,000 members, about 106,807 of whom live in New Mexico, according to Census 2000 figures. The reservation includes approximately 27,000 square miles. Its boundaries extend from northwestern New Mexico into northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah, larger than many states.\nThree smaller bands of Navajos are also located away from the main reservation boundaries at Alamo, To'hajiilee and Ramah. Key cities include Crownpoint, Shiprock, Alamo, To'hajiilee and Ramah. The capital of the Navajo Nation is Window Rock, Ariz., located about 25 miles northwest of Gallup.\n\nDiné is what the Navajo people call themselves in their own language, meaning ""The People."" The Spanish, it is believed, gave the term Navajo, to them when they entered the Southwest. They have endured much suffering in their past, including the infamous Long Walk in 1860 when the U.S. Army forcibly marched more than 8,000 Navajos to Bosque Redondo near Fort Sumner where they were incarcerated for four years before being allowed to return to their homeland. The Treaty of 1864 was established between the Navajos and the U.S. Government, creating the basis for relations still honored today.\n\nThe Navajo Nation is rich in natural and cultural resources. Major attractions include Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park (435-727-5870) and Canyon de Chelly National Monument (928-647-5500) www.nps.gov.chcu in Arizona and parts of Utah. View the Chuska Mountains and Church Rock (visible from Red Rock State Park near Gallup). Chaco Culture National Historical Park (505-786-7014) www.nps.gov.chcu, the Bisti Badlands and Ship Rock Peak also present interesting sites to visit.\n\nCamping, hiking, hunting, and fishing are allowed in various areas with a permit. For more information, call the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department at (928) 871-6636, 871-6647, or the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife at (928) 871-6451, 871-6452.\n\nArt lovers will marvel at the sheer number of Navajo rugs, sand paintings, jewelry and other traditional crafts available throughout the reservation at various trading posts as well as at the tribally owned Navajo Arts & Crafts Enterprise stores, (928) 871-4090. Impressive Navajo silversmithing and dramatically patterned rugs and wall hangings are for sale at monthly auctions in Crownpoint (third Friday of each month) and elsewhere, (505) 786-7386.\n\nIn early October, Shiprock hosts the annual Northern Navajo Fair and Nightway Chant (Yei-Be-Chei Healing Ceremony). No recordings or photos are allowed at the ceremony. Also, visit the Four Corners Navajo Tribal Park, which has a visitor center, demonstration center, Navajo arts and crafts booths, picnic tables and restrooms. P.O. Box 2520, Window Rock, Ariz. 86515; (928) 871-6647, fax: 871-6637. www.navajonationparks.org\n\nThe tribe also hosts the annual Fourth of July Celebration and PRCA Rodeo in Window Rock, as well as the Navajo Nation Fair, usually the Wednesday through Sunday following Labor Day. Billed as ""The World's Largest American Indian Fair,"" the event features a multisanctioned All-Indian Rodeo, traditional Navajo food, song and dance, an intertribal powwow, concerts, parade, the Miss Navajo Nation Pageant and exhibits. Contact the Navajo Nation Fair Office at (928) 871-6478. www.navajonationfair.com\n\nOther places of interest include the Navajo Nation Museum and Library, Ch'ihootso Indian Marketplace, Navajo Nation Zoo and the tribal headquarters, all located in Window Rock. The Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site (928-755-3475) www.nps.gov/hutr, near Ganado, Ariz., is also a fascinating place to visit and shop.\n\nAlso, visit the Four Corners Navajo Tribal Park, which has a visitor center, demonstration center, Navajo arts and crafts booths, picnic tables and restrooms.

"Healthy weight loss tips\n\n\n    * Take one pound at a time\n      Don’t get overwhelmed by how much weight you need to lose. Try to remember that ""losing 15 pounds in two weeks"" is nothing to celebrate. It is important to realize that the more quickly weight is lost, the more likely the loss is coming from water and muscle, not fat.\n\n      Since muscle tissue is critical in keeping our metabolism elevated, losing it actually leads to a decrease in the amount of calories we can each day without gaining weight.\n\n      Fat loss is best achieved when weight is lost slowly. Strive for a weight loss of no more than 3-4 pounds per week. One pound of weight is equivalent to 3500 calories.\n\n\n    * Set Reachable Goals\n      For instance, if you know you need to get more exercise, begin with a manageable goal of, say, walking 10 minutes a day that you know you can achieve. Then build your self-esteem by achieving the small goals you set yourself.\n\n      The same logic applies for losing weight.\n\n    * Stay off the scales\n      Don’t get discouraged when your progress seems to be slow according to your bathroom scales. They do not provide a true measure of what is going on with the body.\n\n      If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.\n\n    * Stay focused on being healthy, not thin\n      # Many people become more successful at long term weight loss when their motive changes from wanting to be thinner to wanting to be healthier. Change your mindset to think about selecting foods that will help your body's health rather than worrying about foods that will affect your body's weight. The Food Pyramid offers a basic outline of the types and amounts of food you should eat each day to give your body the nutrients it needs for optimal health.\n\n    * Fat Free?\n      We've known for some time that limiting high fat foods in the diet can be helpful with weight loss. That's because fats pack in 9 calories per gram compared to only 4 calories per gram from proteins or carbohydrates. To many, the message to limit fats implied an endorsement to eat unlimited amounts of fat-free products. Just to clarify, fat-free foods have calories too. In some cases fat-free foods have as many calories as their fat laden counterparts. If you eat more calories than your body uses, you will gain weight. Eating less fat will help you to lose weight. Eating less fat and replacing it with excessive amounts of fat-free products will not.\n\n    * Drink plenty of water\n      Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.\n\n    * Reward yourself\n      # Each time you reach a goal, such as losing 5 pounds, reward yourself with a gift or a massage.\n\n    * Seek help if you need it\n      # A big key in long term weight control comes from receiving encouragement and support from others. Find a friend to lose weight with or you can check to see if groups such as Weight Watchers, or eDiets offer programs and resources in your area by clicking the links. You may also wish to check with your local hospital to see if their registered dietician conducts group weight loss programs.\n\n    * Watch your portions\n      With the advent of ""supersize"" meals and increasingly huge portions at restaurants, our concept of normal serving sizes is a distant memory. Be mindful of the amounts of food you consume at a sitting. When necessary, divide your food in half and ask for a take home bag. It is all too easy to be a ""plate cleaner"" even when served enormous portions. Learn to pay attention to your hunger level and stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed.\n\n    * Eat your f",2
"Sorry about the abuse thing -- but you found a nice guy anyway -- good for you.  You will feel less stressed if you do indeed find some time just for you.  But that is tough.

Get away for an overnight trip, even if it is just in a local motel, with some champagne cheese and crackers....

"The only difference (aside from size) is the number of available expansion slots.  If you have a desktop chassis and plan on adding internal hardware (like extra hard drives or CD/DVD drives), Desktop chassis on average will run out of room first.  The bigger desktop chassis will give you room for about 4 expansion slots in front whereas the tower chassis is only limited by how large a tower you can find.  So, to answer the part about which is ideal for business use, you need to know how much internal hardware you have now and plan to install in the future.  If you aren't doing anything too big hardware wise, the desktop chassis will probably just save you some space.",4
"Glass is a combination of sand, flint, spar, or some other silicious substances, with one or other of the fixed alkalies, and in some cases with a metallic oxide. Of the alkalies, soda is commonly preferred; and of the silicious substances, white sand is most in repute at present, as it requires no preparation for coarse goods, while mere washing in water is sufficient for those of a finer quality. The metallic oxide usually employed, is litharge, or some other preparation of lead. Iron is used in bottle-glass. \n\nThe silicious matter should be fused in contact with something called a flux. The substances proper for this purpose are lead, borax, arsenic, nitre, or any alkaline matter. The lead is used in the state of red-lead; and the alkalies are soda, pearlash, sea-salt, and wood-ashes. When red-lead is used alone, it gives the glass a yellow cast and requires the addition of nitre to correct it. Arsenic, in the same manner, if used in excess, is apt to render the glass milky. For a perfectly transparent glass, the pearlash is found much superior to lead; perhaps better than any other flux, except it be borax, which is too expensive to be used, except for experiments, or for the best looking-glasses. \n\nThe materials for making glass must first be reduced to powder, which is done in mortars or by horse mills. After sifting out the coarse parts, the proper proportions of silex and flux are mixed together, and put into the calcining furnace, where they are kept in a moderate heat for 5 or 6 hours, being frequently stirred about during the process. When taken out the matter is called frit. Frit is easily converted into glass by only pounding it, and vitrifying it in the melting pots of the glass furnace; but in making fine glass, it will sometimes require a small addition of flux to the frit to correct any fault. For, as the flux is the most expensive article, the manufacturer will rather put too little at first than otherwise, as he can remedy this defect in the melting pot. The heat in the furnace must be kept up until the glass is brought to a state of perfect fusion; and during this process any scum which arises must be removed by ladles. When the glass is perfectly melted, the glass-blowers commence their operations.",1

He asked her to give him some kind of proof to show everyone that he wasn't lying about seeing her, and thats how he got a paint of a virgin on a ""poncho"". \n\nI don't know if this is true or not, but for the story of our lady of Fatima, the catholic church still keeps the ""third secret"" as a secret, The only person who was supposed to know the secret was John Paul II. \n\nFor the Guadalupe story, there's some kind of controversy trying to present the poncho as a miracle.

"There are 2 views regarding Jatropha , its considered as a miraculous in curing many diseases, while some believe it causes cancer.                                                                                                                   Folk Medicine \nAccording to Hartwell, the extracts are used in folk remedies for cancer. Reported to be abortifacient, anodyne, antiseptic, cicatrizant, depurative, diuretic, emetic, hemostat, lactagogue, narcotic, purgative, rubefacient, styptic, vermifuge, and vulnerary, physic nut is a folk remedy for alopecia, anasorca, ascites, burns, carbuncles, convulsions, cough, dermatitis, diarrhea, dropsy, dysentery, dyspepsia, eczema, erysipelas, fever, gonorrhea, hernia, incontinence, inflammation, jaundice, neuralgia, paralysis, parturition, pleurisy, pneumonia, rash, rheumatism, scabies, sciatica, sores, stomachache, syphilis, tetanus, thrush, tumors, ulcers, uterosis, whitlows, yaws, and yellow fever (Duke and Wain, 1981; List and Horhammer, 1969–1979). Latex applied topically to bee and wasp stings (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Mauritians massage ascitic limbs with the oil. Cameroon natives apply the leaf decoction in arthritis (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Colombians drink the leaf decoction for venereal disease (Morton, 1981). Bahamans drink the decoction for heartburn. Costa Ricans poultice leaves onto erysipelas and splenosis. Guatemalans place heated leaves on the breast as a lactagogue. Cubans apply the latex to toothache. Colombians and Costa Ricans apply the latex to burns, hemorrhoids, ringworm, and ulcers. Barbadians use the leaf tea for marasmus, Panamanians for jaundice. Venezuelans take the root decoction for dysentery (Morton, 1981). Seeds are used also for dropsy, gout, paralysis, and skin ailments (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Leaves are regarded as antiparasitic, applied to scabies; rubefacient for paralysis, rheumatism; also applied to hard tumors (Hartwell, 1967–1971). Latex used to dress sores and ulcers and inflamed tongues (Perry, 1980). Seed is viewed as aperient; the seed oil emetic, laxative, purgative, for skin ailments. Root is used in decoction as a mouthwash for bleeding gums and toothache. Otherwise used for eczema, ringworm, and scabies (Perry, 1980; Duke and Ayensu, 1984). We received a letter from the Medicial Research Center of the University of the West Indies shortly after the death of Jamacian singer Robert Morley, ""I just want you to know that this is not because of Bob Morley's illness, why I am revealing this ... my dream was: this old lady came to me in my sleep with a dish in her hands; she handed the dish to me filled with some nuts. I said to her, ""What were those?"" She did not answer. I said to her, ""PHYSIC NUTS."" She said to me, ""This is the cure for cancer."" We found this Jamaican dream rather interesting. Four antitumor compounds, including jatropham and jatrophone, are reported from other species of Jatropha (Duke and Ayensu, 1984). Homeopathically used for cold sweats, colic, collapse, cramps, cyanosis, diarrhea, leg cramps. \nChemistry\nPer 100 g, the seed is reported to contain 6.6 g H2O, 18.2 g protein, 38.0 g fat, 33.5 g total carbohydrate, 15.5 g fiber, and 4.5 g ash (Duke and Atchley, 1983). Leaves, which show antileukemic activity, contain a-amyrin, b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol, 7-keto-b-sitosterol, stigmast-5-ene-3-b, 7-a-diol, and stigmast-5-ene-3 b, 7 b-diol (Morton, 1981). Leaves contain isovitexin and vitexin. From the drug (nut?) saccharose, raffinose, stachyose, glucose, fructose, galactose, protein, and an oil, largely of oleic- and linoleic-acids (List and Horhammer, 1969–1979), curcasin, arachidic-, linoleic-, myristic-, oleic-, palmitic-, and stearic-acids are also reported (Perry, 1980).\n\nThe research in Thailand initially and later around the world have now proved that Jatropha oil can cause skin cancer.

Farming in Japan has never been an especially easy affair, and the life of a farmer could be a difficult one indeed. Much of Japan is mountainous, and yet even after the land was unified under the Tokugawa, each province needed to have some rice-growing potential. A few areas were idea and by the 16th Century had come to the realm's 'breadbaskets' - especially Ise Province and the Kanto Region. The Kanto in particular was well suited to agricultural development, with wide, flat stretches of land for fields and rivers to provide irrigation. Other, more mountainous provinces, like nearby Kai, presented their lords and farmers with many problems, and required a great deal more effort to optimize production. Rice fields were cut into the sides of hills, and rivers arduously dammed and diverted. Yet the work was vital - fa",3

Imagine it acting through your internal organs so I think its kinda like dehydration from within, which is exactly what people try to avoid  when they drink saltwater out of desperation right? hehe.",1

"WC 1966 in England.\n\nMost modern balls are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. The 32-panel configuration is similar to the polyhedron known as the truncated icosahedron, except that it is more spherical, because the faces bulge due to the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by Select in the 1950s in the United States. This configuration became common throughout Continental Europe in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the Adidas Telstar, the official ball of the 1970 World Cup.\n\nOlder balls were usually stitched from 18 oblong non-waterproof leather panels, similar to the design of modern volleyballs and Gaelic footballs, and laced to allow access to the internal air bladder. This configuration is still common, as are more novel ones, such as the 26-panel Mitre PRO 100T, and the 14-panel Adidas Teamgeist. There are also indoor footballs, which are made of one or two pieces of plastic. Often these have designs printed on them to resemble a stitched leather ball.",5

"Yes, 1865W via direct conversion...but its important to remember that the compressors in A/C systems are VERY high inductance, so the voltage waveform leads the current waveform quite a bit, and lowers the power factor. Im not sure how many more watts (its gonna be 100s) the system would use since I dont know the motor specification.\n\nThe best way to determine the power usage is to read the RLA (run load amps) off of the compressor, and multiply that by the input voltage. This still isnt too great of a way, but its better than an HP conversion for sure. \n\nIf the compressor only lists the LRA (locked rotor amps, current flow at 0 back EMF), divide that number by 5 for a rotary compressor (Cylindrical) or 4 for a hermetic sphere compressor (egg like) to get the RLA. Doing this further decreases your accuracy of course. \n\nHope all this helps",1

"In a patient with a dry socket, blood does not fill up the extraction socket or the blood clot is lost. The gums can not grow over the extraction socket because there's nothing to grow over and the hole remains open. This opening causes a constant dull throbbing pain and the patient can often have a foul smelling breath and bad taste in the mouth. Ear pain is another possible dry socket symptom.\n\n          It's called a dry socket because the hole, or socket, that the tooth used to fit into becomes dry. It begins hurting about three days after oral surgery. Unfortunately, the pain lasts about a week after it begins. The dental name is acute alveolar osteitis. Acute means all of a sudden. Alveolar is the name of the bone that supports teeth. -itis means inflamed and osteo- means bone. Osteitis means bone inflammation. Acute alveolar osteitis means sudden inflammation of the bone that supports a tooth.\n\n          Dentists don't know exactly what causes a dry socket. It occurs more with lower teeth than upper teeth and more with females than males. The problem occurs more often after difficult extractions. It may be that forceful pushing against the wall of the socket when the tooth is being removed causes the walls of the tooth socket to become crushed. This prevents bleeding into the socket because the blood vessels have been crushed closed. The lack of blood then causes severe pain.\n\n          Anything that dislodges the clot can cause a dry socket. Forceful spitting or sucking though a straw can pull a clot completely out of its socket. Patients should wait a day before rinsing with warm salt water to avoid dissolving the new blood clot. When salt water rinsing, spit gently to avoid pressure. Carbonated beverages should be avoided because they may bubble the clot out. Alcoholic drinks can dry out the blood clot and prevent healing. Avoid smoking for a few days after dental extractions because smoking can disturb clot formation. Patients who have recently had oral surgery should avoid anything that may irritate the socket or anything that may cause the clot from being dislodged. Follow our oral surgery post operative instructions carefully to avoid dry socket treatment.",2

"I just recently changed careers so I am not in education any longer.  However, I do have some insight into your question.  I think the biggest problem is the lack of equity in how money is given out to schools in a given district.  The U.S. Department of Education gives out money based on a formula and the state divvies it out.  \n\nIronically, schools in districts where the poorer kids live have broken down schools with out dated books, doors coming off the hinges, leaky roofs and other conditions that can inhibit a student’s ability to learn.  Then you look at schools in more affluent neighborhoods, and they have schools that look like a castle and have better equipment and supplies.  \n\nWho makes the decisions about what schools get treated better?  Somehow, it makes it hard for a principal to help teachers and students when he isn’t getting a fair share of the pie.  Students in poor districts deserve to learn just as much as the kids in the rich neighborhoods.  But why is there such a difference in the quality of their schools and accompanying supplies?    Until that question is honestly answered, we will forever have a big learning problem in American Education. \n\nThis is what I think based on what I have observed.",3

It can refer to excitation either by oneself or by another (see mutual masturbation). It is part of a larger set of activities known as autoeroticism, which also includes the use of sex toys and non-genital stimulation. There are also masturbation machines used to simulate intercourse. Masturbation and sexual intercourse are the two most common sexual practices, but they are not mutually exclusive (for example, many people find the sight of their partner masturbating highly erotic). Some people are able to achieve orgasm only through masturbation and not sexual intercourse. In the animal kingdom, masturbation has been observed in many mammalian species, both in the wild and in captivity.",2

"Protons carry a positive electric charge.  Electrons carry a negative electric charge.  The magnitude of the charge carried on both the, positive, protons and the, negative, electrons are equal....meaning that the total electric charge on an object is zero only if the number of protons exactly equals the number of electrons.\n\nIn an atom, for example, the net electric charge is zero and there are equal numbers of protons and electrons.  When an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons (in the case when the atom is oxidized or reduced...loosing electrons or gaining electrons), the atom becomes an ion and has a net charge.\n\nIf something does have an unequal balance between protons and electrons and has a net charge, it will be attracted/repelled to other objects with a net charge as well.  Like charges repel and dissimilar charges attract, so all the + charges will attract all the - charges and vice-versa, eventually forming overall neutral objects.",1

"Another Jewish source, the Talmud, makes several historical references to Jesus. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the Talmud is ""the collection of ancient Rabbinic writings consisting of the Mishnah and the Gemara, constituting the basis of religious authority for traditional Judaism."" Although not explicitly referred to by name, later rabbis identify the person as Jesus. These references to Jesus are neither sympathetic to Him or His Church. Also these writings were preserved through the centuries by Jews, so Christians cannot be accused of tampering with the text.\n\nThe Talmud makes note of Jesus' miracles. No attempt is made to deny them, but it ascribes them to magical arts from Egypt. Also His crucifixion is dated as ""on the eve of the Feast of the Passover"" in agreement with the Gospel (Luke 22:1ff; John 19:31ff). Similar again to the Gospel (Matt. 27:51), the Talmud records the earthquake and the tearing in two of the Temple curtain during the time of Jesus' death. Josephus in his book, The Jewish War, also confirmed these events.\n\nBy the beginning of the 2nd century, Romans were writing about Christians and Jesus. Pliny the Younger, proconsul in Asia Minor, in 111 A.D. wrote to Emperor Trajan in a letter:\n\n...it was their habit on a fixed day to assemble before daylight and recite by turns a form of words to Christ as a god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but not to commit theft or robbery, or adultery, not to break their word, and not to deny a deposit when demanded. After this was done, their custom was to depart, and meet again to take food... [Pliny, Epistle 97]\n\nSpecial attention should be made to the phrase, ""to Christ as a god,"" an early secular witness to the belief in Christ's divinity (John 20:28; Phil. 2:6). Also it is interesting to compare this passage with Acts 20:7-11, a biblical account of an early Christian Sunday celebration.\n\nNext the Roman historian, Tacitus, who is respected by modern scholars for historical accuracy, wrote in 115 A.D. about Christ and His Church:\n\nThe author of the denomination was Christ[us] who had been executed in Tiberius time by the Procurator Pontius Pilate. The pestilent superstition, checked for a while, burst out again, not only throughout Judea...but throughout the city of Rome also... [Tacitus, Annals, XV 44]\n\nEven with disdain for the Christian faith, Tacitus still treated the execution of Christ as historical fact, drawing connections to Roman events and leaders. (cf. Luke 3:1ff)\n\nOther secular witnesses to the historical Jesus include Suetonius in his biography of Claudius, Phlegan recording the eclipse of the sun during Jesus' death and even Celsus, a pagan philosopher. It must be kept in mind that most of these sources were not only secular but anti-Christian. These secular authors, including the Jewish writers, had no desire or intention to promote Christianity. They had no motivation to distort their reports in favor of Christianity. Pliny actually punished Christians for their faith. If Jesus were a myth or His execution a hoax, Tacitus would have reported it as such. He certainly would not have connected Jesus' execution to Roman leaders. These writers presented Jesus as a real historical person. Denying the reliability of these sources in connection to Jesus would cast serious suspicion on the rest of ancient history.\n\nNow these ancient secular writings do not prove that Jesus is the Son of God or even the Christ, but that is not the goal of this tract. These reports show that a virtuous person named Jesus did live in the early first century A.D. and authored a religious movement (which still exists today). This Person was at least called Christ - the Messiah. Christians in the first century also appeared to consider Him God. Finally these writings support other facts found in the Bible surrounding His life. The claim that Jesus never existed and H",0

"Saturn's largest moon is Titan.Titan is the fifteenth of Saturn's known satellites and the largest.\n        orbit:1,221,830 km from Saturn\n        diameter: 5150 km\n        mass:     1.35e23 kg\nIn Greek mythology the Titans were a family of giants, the children of Uranus and Gaia, who sought to rule the heavens but were overthrown and supplanted by the family of Zeus. \nDiscovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. \nIt was long thought that Titan was the largest satellite in the solar system but recent observations have shown that Titan's atmosphere is so thick that its solid surface is slightly smaller than Ganymede's. Titan is nevertheless larger in diameter than Mercury and larger and more massive than Pluto.\n    Surface view One of the principal objectives of the Voyager 1 mission was the study of Titan. Voyager 1 came within 4000 km of the surface. We learned more in the few minutes of that fly-by than in the previous 300 years. Then in late 2004, the Cassini orbiter began a series of close encounters with Titan, taking data with many instruments. And in January 2005, the Huygens probe actually landed on the surface of Titan and sent back images from the surface. \n    Titan is similar in bulk composition to Ganymede, Callisto, Triton and (probably) Pluto, ie about half water ice and half rocky material. It is probably differentiated into several layers with a 3400 km rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystal forms of ice. its interior may still be hot. Though similar in composition to Rhea and the rest of Saturn's moons, it is denser because it is so large that its gravity slightly compresses its interior. \n    Smoggy Titan Alone of all the satellites in the solar system, Titan has a significant atmosphere. At the surface, its pressure is more than 1.5 bar (50% higher than Earth's). It is composed primarily of molecular nitrogen (as is Earth's) with no more than 6% argon and a few percent methane. Interestingly, there are also trace amounts of at least a dozen other organic compounds (i.e. ethane, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide) and water. The organics are formed as methane, which dominates in Titan's upper atmosphere, is destroyed by sunlight. The result is similar to the smog found over large cities, but much thicker. In many ways, this is similar to the conditions on Earth early in its history when life was first getting started. But it is this thick hazy atmosphere that makes it so hard to see Titan's surface. \n    Titan has no magnetic field and sometimes orbits outside Saturn's magnetosphere. It is therefore directly exposed to the solar wind. This may ionize and carry away some molecules from the top of the atmosphere. It may also drive some of Titan's peculiar chemistry. \n    At the surface, Titan's temperature is about 94 K (-290 F). At this temperature water ice does not sublimate and thus there is little water vapor in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, there appears to be a lot of chemistry going on; the end result seems to be a lot like a very thick smog. \n    There are scattered variable clouds in Titan's atmosphere in addition to the overall deep haze. These clouds are probably composed of methane, ethane or other simple organics. Other more complex chemicals in small quantities must be responsible for the orange color as seen from space. Analysis of the Huygens data will tell us a great deal about the details of the atmospheric chemistry. \n    Erosion features Prior to Cassini's arrival, it seemed likely that the clouds would produce a rain of ethane or methane onto the surface perhaps producing an ""ocean"" up to 1000 meters deep. However, this seems not to be the case at least at the present time. There is little doubt that some active processes are occuring on Titan; there are few if any craters visible indicating that the surface must be very young. But it may be that the ""lakes"" are more slushy",1

"First, pay off all short term debt. If you have a credit card interest rate of say, 21%, that's an instant tax-free return of 21% per year on your money.\n\nNext, if your company has a 401(k) with matching funds, fund your 401(k) to the maximum match amount.

If you have money left over after you've funded the 401(k) to the maximum match, do this step with the extra money.\n\nIf you *still* have more money for long-term investing, go back to the 401(k) and invest in that up to what you can afford.\n\nAnd get yourself an elementary education in personal finance.

"Count your calories. Yes, it sounds old fashioned, but that really is the best way. Remember what a calorie is--energy! Measure the energy in and make sure that the energy that goes out is higher. For me, about 1900 calories a day is maintenance weight, meaning that the calories in=calories out. My dieting calorie count is 1500. You need to have a daily calorie target, but you can be slightly over or under each day. Small fluctuations don't hurt anything. For me, I always craved a beer, a glass of wine, and/or a snack about 9 PM. Now, I have just one of those things, and that's the only thing (with calories) I eat or drink after dinner. Drink lots of water, eat breakfast, and watch your portion control! Make sure that you eat a balanced diet--the food you eat needs to count nutritionally.",2

"""Hotness"" is very subjective. Every person's tastes differ. Personally, I've always had a bit of a thing for redheads and Asians, but I've been completely struck by a couple women who didn't fall into either category, so easily. Physically, every man can debate whatever physical trait they find aesthetically pleasing, but I think that there's one personality trait that's universal: CONFIDENCE.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing sexier than a truly confident, self-assured woman. One of my ex-girlfriends I dated for three years, and I loved her, but she was so cripplingly, self-deprecating, that it truly ruined our relationship. You can only compliment someone and assure them so many times before you let their negativity destroy you. Apparantly three years was pretty much my limit, and I'll never make that mistake again.

"You will find ""peace"" at death. Don't be afraid of that, it's simply the graduation from the physical into the nonphysical. Completely natural and completely inevitable. It has been said by wise men from time immemorial that ""if you're happy you don't know what's going on"". That's as true now as it has always been, actually maybe more so given the violent state of mans affairs at this time. So don't be consumed with the search for peace. Be consumed instead with searching for the laws of God which are written in the hearts of every creature in creation. It is within you, (as Jesus and hundreds of others have said) hidden from the uncleaness of personal greed and mans cruelty to man. It can be discovered by any who will search, ANY, period! But you must begin by putting the darkness of the so-called ""churches"" away from you. And unfortunately that's the most difficult part of the journey toward godliness and the part that stops most seekers. We are so indoctrinated with the mistakes perpetuated by the church that for most of us it is all but impossible to accept the timeless wisdom. There are few who can even accept this basic truth so have no hope of going any farther. The quest for higher knowledge is timeless, it's universal, it has no name, and it is dormant within every person born into this dimension. It requires only wakening by searching for facts based upon facts, not dogma, and it surpasses organized ""religion"" as a skyscraper surpasses a birdhouse. It's message is even concealed in almost everything around us, learn what to look for, you'll never go back once you've set your foot on the path. Believe me!!!",0

"I am a nuclear medicine technologist.  And I think you are talking about a cardiac stress imaging test.  I don't know exactly how the facility you are doing it at does their's, there's several ways to do it.  I am assuming it is the rest/stress method.  So, what they will do is inject you with a radioisotope while you are at rest, wait about 20 minutes and image your heart for about 15 minutes or so.  Then you come back in about 1-2 hours and they will run you on the treadmill to reach your target heart rate, once in is reached, they will inject a radioisotope again while your heart is in a stress state.  They will put you on the camera again and image your heart for 15-20 minutes.  This time they will hook up some ekg leads to synchronize your heartbeat with the camera.  \n   The purpose of imaging your heart in a rest and stress state is to find spots where the radioactive medicine didn't perfuse to in the heart muscle.  When you exercise the coronary arteries dialate and blood usually perfuses to the heart muscle better.  Now if the pictures show an area where there was no perfusion on rest and stress images, that means that is dead muscle that cannot be repaired by increasing perfusion to the muscle, it probably died when you had a heart attack or some chest pain over time.  But if the images show a area that didn't perfuse on rest, but then it did get blood to it when you exercised and opened up those coronary vessels, then it is fixable.  They will probably put in a stent and/or do blood thinner therapy to get blood to that heart muscle so it doesn't die.",2

"Well let's see.... raising melons can be a difficult and rewarding job. the standard size of a canteloupe with the proper care could be the size of a NBA regulation basketball that is if you really care for your melon. You see the canteloupe is one of the shyest melons because it has a lot to live up to being the one of the more common ones. I have found that if you spend several hours telling the melon that it is big enough and strong enoung and gosh darn it people like it, it does rather well. Now musk and honeydew are a little trickier. The tactic that has yielded the largest size in these varieties for me has been to play them against each other. I plant little seeds of jealousy like telling the honeydew that ""You know why Aunt Betty always used musk melon in her 4th of July salads dont you? Its because it was bigger than you honey, its not that it tastes better its just that you havent given it your all."" With the musk usually a comment about its name works, something like, ""Come on lets get real, just listen to your name, musk. If you had to choose between a melon named musk or honey which one would you choose?.....honey of course. I conotates a more delicious experience in every way. The only way you'll ever get picked is if you dazzle them with your size so get busy and get big"" Using this stratagey has yielded melons the size of a bowling ball. Who else loves to watch pro-bowling isnt it amazing to watch? Theres just something about those people gently scooping up those shining beauties wiping them down with the same wrag that they use on thier own sweat as the precurser to the big show, that shiny spinning beautiful warrior gracefully on its journey to meet its battle with the 10 evil white advancing monguls. Before you know it *BLAM-O* the battle is over and we see just how well our little warrior did. Ahhh, oops... I guess I got a little off track, sorry. Anyways,... as far as the sweating part it all depends on where your melon farm is located. I have had many farms in many locales.

"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesised in serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system and enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIn the central nervous system, serotonin is believed to play an important role in the regulation of mood, sleep, emesis (vomiting), sexuality and appetite. Serotonin has been thought to play a part in many disorders, notably as part of the biochemistry of depression, migraine, bipolar disorder and anxiety.\n\nThe name ""serotonin"" is something of a misnomer and reflects the circumstances of the compound's discovery. It was initially identified as a vasoconstrictor substance in blood serum - hence serotonin, a serum agent affecting vascular tone. This agent was later chemically identified as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and, as the broad range of physiological roles were elucidated, 5-HT became the preferred name in the pharmacological field.",1

"What causes lightning?\nLightning originates around 15,000 to 25,000 feet above sea level when raindrops are carried upward until some of them convert to ice. For reasons that are not widely agreed upon, a cloud-to-ground lightning flash originates in this mixed water and ice region. The charge then moves downward in 50-yard sections called step leaders. It keeps moving toward the ground in these steps and produces a channel along which charge is deposited. Eventually, it encounters something on the ground that is a good connection. The circuit is complete at that time, and the charge is lowered from cloud to ground. \nThe return stroke is a flow of charge (current) which produces a luminosity much brighter than the part that came down. This entire event usually takes less than half a second. \n\nWhat causes thunder?\nThunder is caused by lightning. The bright light of the lightning flash caused by the return stroke mentioned above represents a great deal of energy. This energy heats the air in the channel to above 50,000 degrees F in only a few millionths of a second! The air that is now heated to such a high temperature had no time to expand, so it is now at a very high pressure. The high pressure air then expands outward into the surrounding air compressing it and causing a disturbance that propagates in all directions away from the stroke. The disturbance is a shock wave for the first 10 yards, after which it becomes an ordinary sound wave, or thunder. \n\nThunder can seem like it goes on and on because each point along the channel produces a shock wave and sound wave.",1

"Excel is the spreadsheet that comes with Microsoft Office.\n\nA spreadsheet is, at its most basic, a grid of boxes where you can enter numbers and equations.  Each box (called a cell) has a specific address, based on the row number and the column.  The first cell is A1, the one below it is A2, and the one to the right of it is B1.  Pretty simple so far, right?\n\nKnowing no more than this, you can use Excel as nothing more than a convenient editor for tabular data.  In fact, this is primarily what Excel is for... except instead of just putting in tabular data it can also calculate the data for you.\n\nHere's an example:  I had a garage sale recently and recorded each sale in the spreadsheet. It was pretty simple.  (Actually, I'm lying to you.  It was a complex spreadsheet that tracked a lot of different things like donor, category, and sales goals, but I'm simplifying it for this answer.  It COULD have been a simple spreadsheet).  \n\nIn the 'A' column I listed the item that was sold.  In the B column I listed the price of the item.  A ways down the B column--say row 100--I put an equation in by typing ""=sum(B1:B99)"" which meant to add up all the numbers in the cells from B1 to B99.  Now I had a functional spreadsheet that automatically updated the total sold so far.  Any time I typed in a new purchase, BAM!  There was the new total.  A lot easier than adding it up on paper, no?\n\nThis is basically what a spreadsheet is.  It can format numbers as percentages, dollar amounts, etc.  Basic math works like ""=A5+B6"" or ""=C12+10"" and so forth--each cell's address can be treated as a variable in the equation, and you can type in literal numbers as well..  The more common equations (average, total, etc) have buttons for them on the top.  For the more advanced ones I usually recommend choosing ""function"" from the insert menu.\n\nYou'd be surprised what excel can do.  It's pretty simple on the surface, but has tremendous power beneath.  \n\nI hope this answered your question.  Good luck to you.",4

"Rutgers does have a shot to make it to the title game, only if the following happens though.\n\nFlorida loses the SEC title game to Arkansas which already lost to LSU putting both teams at two losses.  USC beats Cal but loses to Notre Dame.  Bama beats Auburn.  Texas loses the Big XII title game or loses to Texas A&M.  Rutgers wins out.\n\nAlmost all of that would have to happen for Rutgers to move into the top 2 spots.  Rutgers is doing ok in the computers and they can only get better if they keep winning, with another top ten opponent coming up its possible if some of the abo ve happens they could make it.  Most importantly though they need to win out.  I see them moving into the top ten this week in the BCS by virtue of the computers and the fact that their SOS will have moved up from the low 90s into the upper 70s.

"Yes, negativity is very unhealthy, both mentally and physically (diseases such as cancer and heart-disease have been linked to a negative, pessimistic attitude, seriously!) Although it takes effort, the method for eliminating negativity is relatively simple: Thought Replacement. For the next week, keep a notebook with you at all times, and, when you catch yourself having a negative thought, write it down. Then, write down a positive replacement for that thought. For example; If your negative thought is ""I look awful, today!"" Replace that with something positive like ""Hey, at least my hair looks good, and if I put on my favourite shirt, I'll feel even better about my appearance."" Or, if your thought is ""I am so overwhelmed, I'm not going to be able to get everything done!"" Replace that with ""I'm just going to put one foot in front of the other and do what I can. There's always tomorrow if I don't finish this today!"" Your replacement thoughts don't have to be perfect. The point is, to get yourself into the habit of thinking and reacting more positively. If you find this difficult, try writing your replacement thoughts from the point of view of a best friend (who has your best interests at heart, of course). For example, if your thought is ""That new guy I went out with last week still hasn't called me back. He must think I'm boring and unattractive!"" , your ""inner best friend"" might say: ""I'm sure he's just been really busy, and so what if he doesn't call back?! You're an amazing woman and if he can't see that, he doesn't deserve you!"" After a week, practice replacing your thoughts without writing them down...just think them! It will get easier and more automatic until one day <POOF!>, you're a positive person! Positive thinking is the greatest gift you can give yourself! Enjoy!",2

"On a purely statistical basis, yes.\nCounterexamples such as Bill Gates are nonsense. Of course you can find single cases in contrast with every statistics, but you should look at the average trends emerging from big numbers, not single cases.\nThe reason for this correlation is evolutionary: good looking people have - on average - more choices for mating. On big numbers this means an advantage for better mates in all respects, including wealth. On the opposite, wealthy people can choose easily good looking mates.\nGood looking wealthy people will breed children who (again, on average) will inherit both money and good looking aspect, so the whole process is self-sustaining.",0

"As a wedding planner I have a bias view, but I can tell you this much...\n\nA planner does NOT plan the wedding FOR you... a good planner plans it WITH you so that you get your dream wedding, all they do is take the pressure off of your shoulders (dealing with vendors, dealing with family disagreements over what SHOULD be, taking care of the Etiquette issues for you, etc)\n\nA planner will have connections you might not otherwise have, they already know the in's and out's of the business, they know who to contact when and will keep you on track and within your budget (not so many worries about going overboard if someone is always keeping you informed), If you get a REALLY good planner they might possibly be able to guarantee you that they will save you an amount equal to or greater than the fee you are paying for their services (effectively making their help FREE).\n\nThe drawbacks?  Well, our services can be a bit pricey depending on what services you want and where you live. You also might find that wedding planners can be just as ""shifty"" as the next vendor... So DO YOUR HOMEWORK!  Get references and CALL THEM!  Find out how long they have been in business, how many weddings they have done, etc.  Get DETAILS on how they are paid... do they only get paid by you? do they get ""kickbacks"" for using particular vendors? Etc.  If they take kickbacks cross them off your list... this means they will use the vendor who pays them over a better one that doesnt, which causes a conflict of interest!\n\nIt can be daunting, but once you have the right planner..... it will be well worth it.\nIf you choose to go it alone.... GET HELP! Bridesmaids, Mothers, etc. You will need someone to help you keep on top of everything, and you might want to consider hiring a ""Day of"" coordinator anyway... that way it is all covered on your big day and you can rest easy.\n\nAlso, if you are having over 150 people it is a very good idea to have a planner, anything under 150 and its not as hard to Do it yourself.\n\nGood Luck, and if you have any other questions feel free to email me, I will do my best to assist you.",8

Of course, the Army always wants more soldiers in a location, no matter how many are there already.\n\nAlso, Charlie Rangel is a member of the House of Representatives, not the Senate.

However, F*cked up states like CA and NY do require registration IF you are EVEN allowed to purchase a firearm. \nYou did not specify what state you are in, so it is difficult to answer your question of whether or not you can purchase a firearm in another state and keep it in another, you need to edit your question and be specific.\n I do, however, understand your plight. I'm from CA and when I returned from my enlistment, I was infuriated I could not purchase a firearm with out waiting for weeks for a 'cool down' period and paying outrageous fees. So I got a job where I was allowed to carry a gun and used that everywhere I went. But it's hard to go around irrational laws this way so not everyone can do this. I also understand the concern of having to register your guns with ANYONE. People like some of the other answerer's immediately think you are up to no good when you wanna PURCHASE a firearm but forget that personal protection is not guaranteed by the police, only yourself. \nYou can purchase a firearm in a surrounding state like Arizona and even 'open' carry it without a permit in THAT state, but you have to list a residential address in that state and you cannot transport the firearm back to CA, where I THINK  you are from, without listing it in that state,(CA).

"The speed of light is dependent on the medium in which it is traveling.  Light CAN be slowed down.\n\nIn a vacuum, light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s.  However, in other medius, like air or glass for example, light will slow down.  The more optically dense the medium , the more it slows down.  We can define a quanity, called the index of refraction (n), which will help us determine the speed of light in a substance.\nThe higher the index of refraction, the slower light travels.\n\nThe velocity at which light propigates (v) is inversely proportional to the index of refraction (n).\nv = c/n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nIn a perfect vacuum, the index of refraction is exactly 1.  Air has an index of refraction of just slightly above 1, but often, since it is so close, we can just round it off to be 1.  Glass however (depending on the type) can have much higher indexies of refraction, (~1.3 - 1.5 roughly).\nWhen air moves from lower index of refraction to a higher index of refraction (or vice-versa) it is bent.  This bending of light is due to the fact that the light is slowing down as it enters the medium, which is the case in a prism.\nDifferent wavelengths of light have different indexies of refraction, all wavelengths do not slow down equally.  This is the reason why blue light is bent more easily than red light and appear at opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nLigh DOES slow down as it enters a more optically dense medium.",1

"It's used for estimating fuel costs.\n\nEach town has an average number of heating degree days for the winter and average number of cooling degree days for the summer.\n\nWith those averages, you can calculate how long the air conditioner or heater will run for the year and then calculate the fuel costs.\n\n\n\nYou can calculate it from the average temperature each day.\n\nExample:\nAverage temperature for Jan. 1 is 30°F.\n65°F - 30°F = 35°F\n\nJan 1 is one day, so 35° difference * 1 day = 35 heating degree days\n\n\nAverage temperature for Jan. 2 is 35°F.\n65°F - 35°F = 30°F\n\nJan 2 is one day, so 30° difference * 1 day = 30 heating degree days\n\nYou do this for every of the year and add it up.\n\nJan 1 = 35 heating degree days\nJan 2 = 30 heating degree days\nJan 3 = \nJan 4 = \n\nAdd it all up and you get the number of heating degree days for the winter.",1

"Everyday. I am 23 years old. I can shoot with both feet. I can dribble and run as fast as slim boys. I am overweight by 30 kilograms, about 75 pounds. I weight 230 pounds and my height is 5'10'' (1 meter and 78 centimeters). I have a wide body from the pectorals to the legs. This made easier for me to dribble, the other players just will hit against my body as if it were a wall.\n\n   I also can header the ball with real strenght. The main way to do this is to run from a point were the ball is not pointed directly to you. For example, ask your friend (the one who is centerin the ball to pass the ball to a point in front of you) always have in mind that the his pass must be not really fast, otherwise you will not reach the ball. Then, jump curling your body in a > greater than sign form, try to get a good position before trying this jump. Next, curl your body to a smaller than position < sign form. Got it.? I hope so.\n\n   To shoot with real precision (accuracy) you do not need to hit the ball hard nor use your toes. Just hit the ball with the interior side of your foot. To shoot blazing shoots just run as fast as you can and hit the ball with the upper side of the foot. If your feet are big, try to inclinate your body to the opposite side the ball is being shoot from. From example if you shoot using the right foot inclinate your body to the left as much as you can. \n\n  There is another way to shoot really hard. Run towards the ball and while you shoot, jump so your foot will not hit the ground. Like this . /| (the point here represents the the ball, the slash represents the shooting foot and the vertical line represents the other leg, which is known as the point of support for your body).\n\n  I hope this will help you improve your soccer abilities. :D Maybe you do not need to improve, but I gave you these tips anyway.",5

"The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. The treaty resulted in France's loss of all its possessions in North America (all of Canada was ceded to Britain) except Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands off Newfoundland. France also kept the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique because of their rich sugar crops and the ease with which it could be controlled. Spain gained Louisiana in compensation for its loss of Florida to the British.\n\nOne result of the war was that Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the St. Lawrence River that now forms part of the Province of Quebec with approximately 54,000 French-speaking, Roman Catholic population. Near the beginning of the war, in 1755, the British had expelled French-speaking populations in Acadia to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population, but this would not be repeated in 1763.\n\nThe European theater of the war was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on February 15, 1763.",3

"Divide both sides by 16 to get x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1, which is the standard form. Since x^2 is positive, that tells you that this hyperbola opens horizontally. Because you just have a  plain x^2 and y^2, the center is (0,0). The square root of the number under the x^2 term gives you the distance of the vertices from the center, so the vertices are at (a,0) and (-a,0). The asymptotes are lines with the slope formed by +/- b/a. To find the foci, calculate c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and go that distance from the center horizontally, so the foci are at (c,0) and (-c,0).

"There's a lot of ways, I'm sure you'll get alot of answers, so here are a few:\n\n1) External USB hard drive\n-- this is the easiest way, IMHO.  All you do is plug it into the wall, plug it into the USB port, and you are done!  You can get an 80GB drive for less than $100.  Also, you can easily bring your HD to another computer, at work for instance.  The downside is transfer rates.  If you have a old computer, it might only support USB1.0, which will be slower than 2.0 (USB2.0 devices will work with USB1.0, but data transfer will be slower).  USB1.0 is fine for reading MP3's, but it will be a little slow when transfering large amounts of data back and forth.  (Looking at the specs on DELL, it looks like your computer has USB2.0).\n\nHere are some USB hard drives:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=br_ss_hs/104-6257906-0810344?search-alias=aps&keywords=external%20USB%20hard%20drive\n\n2) Internal Harddrive\n-- Looks like you have a notebook.  This is rather more complex, you have to buy a HD with more capacity than your existing HD, transfer your contents over using another computer, then install the new HD.  I wouldn't go this route.\n\n3) Network Attached Storage (NAS)\n\nA little more complex and expensive than external USB.  The benefits is you can mount this to your home/work network, and any computer on the network can access it.  However, this means you have to have a network at home, typically with some sore of DHCP server (most home routers).  Networking setup takes more time than setting up the USB.  The cheaper NAS devices I have seen, from Netgear for instance, have poorer user reviews than the simpler USB drives.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RML8S/sr=8-1/qid=1142849285/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6257906-0810344?%5Fencoding=UTF8\n\nHope that helps, I'm sure you'll get more options from other users.",4

"Belief in miracles is a concept. But faith in god an absolute necessity.\n\n\nBefore we proceed discussion on miracles, we need to understand the meaning of miracles. What does it actually mean? What does actually happen when we hear someone say, ""a miracle has happened""?\n\nThe famous Ganesha episode drinking the milk was the biggest miracle of all the times.\n\n\nMiracles are not to be. No human being on earth can create a miracle. It can never happen. Yes, some people... some renowned Saints while pursuing their Spiritual career gain some Tantric powers which helps them healing the needy.\n\nIt so happened a poor man turned up in presence of Bhagwan Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism and asked him for help. In his hands was the dead body of his young son. He begged of Bhagwan Mahavira to put back life into his son. Mahavira point blank refused... he stated he does not have the power to put life into someone... neither it is possible for any other human being to do so. Neither he could perform even a single miracle.\n\n\nHe repeatedly emphasized that every human being has the power within to invoke the positive energy of the Cosmos. This only happens when we develop a positive attitude towards life. This is practically what is being done in Reiki. Summing up in Reiki, one is taught to invoke the positive energy source and use it for curing the defective area of the body. It is like chanelising all the power within the means of human being towards a particular area as happens in the case of a dam.\n\nIn any hydroelectric project the principal means of generating energy is... a huge quantity of water is stored in a lake and this raw water is made to stand for a while. After the sedimentation of the particles floating in the water has occurred... the clear water is passed through tunnels, the starting point of which is located on a much higher platform than the outer end of the tunnel. This makes the water gush out with great pressure. This water is made to pass through a turbine before it reaches the outer end. The rotation of the turbine generates electricity.\n\n\nMere channelising of water through a tunnel which has a very steep slope and keeping a turbine in the path of the water generates the requisite energy... similarly if we need to heal our body... we need to concentrate all the positive energies which either exist in the body or can be invoked from the mighty reservoir of Cosmos and directed towards a particular goal. This goal can be healing the ailing body or even pursuing a higher goal in life.\n\nIf we look at the matter deeply... the student who comes first in the class and the student who comes last... there is not much difference except in their thinking. The one who comes first sincerely concentrates his total energies towards the desired goal of life. The one coming last has yet to find a definite goal in life. One who comes last fritters away his energy to no avail.\n\n\nWhenever we expect of a saint to perform a miracle... what actually happens is that the words of the saint inspires us and makes us concentrate our energies towards a particular goal.

"According to the Bible, God loved Abraham and promised him that from him he would make a nation. Abraham had faith in God's promise even though he and his wife Sarah were getting very old and had no children. Sarah did not share the same faith as Abraham. After some time, she presented her slave Haggar (an Egyptian) to Abraham so that they could conceive a child. Hence, Ishmael (Arabs) was born. Sarah later became pregnant with Issac (Jews). Once Issac was born, Sarah could not bear to look at Haggar and her son. Sarah made Abraham send Haggar and Ishmael away. Genesis ch.15-18, 21.\nBoth Isaac and Ishmael are fathers of nations. The Jews are God's chosen people because the orginal promise was for Abraham and his wife Sarah.",0

"Some, yes. For example, a new vaccine is now promising to significantly reduce the cases of cervical cancer. It is estimated that as many as 2/3 of the cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). It follows, therefore, that reducing the incidence of infection from HPV will also reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Viruses as well as bacteria have been implicated in a number of other cancers. Heliobacter pylori (H Pylori) infections in the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to certain lymphomas of the gut. \n\nViruses sometimes work indirectly in causing cancers. For example, both AIDS and hepatitis are caused by viruses and they subsequently weaken the body and make it more susceptible to cancer. AIDS destroys the immune system and makes it harder for the body to ward off viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells.  Sadly, people suffering from AIDS are at a much higher risk for a multitude of cancers which the body would normally be able to protect itself from (including viruses like Epstein-Barr and certain herpesviruses that are themselves linked to cancer). Hepatitis increases the likelihood of liver cancer.\n\nHopefully, researchers will one day find an effective vaccine against viruses that are in one way or another linked to cancer.",2

"It was pretty clear from the fact that you have asked this twice that you did not get the answer that you were looking for so here is my try !!!\n\nThe First Answers on the other question were good, but doppler was made a little bit clearer when put to me like this.When applied to Sound Waves.  Have you heard a train horn coming toward you then away from you? The same horn at first sounds higher in frequency as the waves are compressing together in front of the train. Then as it passes, goes away the same horn sounds lower in frequency because now the waves are stretching out, reaching us at a lower rate per second this is the doppler effect.  I only say a train because it is the only vehicle that usually single=horned you can hear clearly like this.  A car passing if it blows it's horn will create the same effect and do the exact same thing. It's just not so noticeable.\n\nDoppler is how the Police catch you speeding! The early radar units were actually calibrated by the officers in the field using the back and forth motion of a common music tuning fork! (The back and forth motion of a certain note represented a certain specific MPH).\n\nDoppler really only refers to the change of frequency reflected from the target. If it is higher, then the target is coming toward the receiving antenna. If it is lower in frequency, the target is going away from the receiving antenna. The more the frequency shift, the faster the movement. \n\nConventional radar only shows the return signal, and does not measure its frequency shift from that which was transmitted.\n\nHope this helps you.\n\nThats basic Doppler 101\n\nThere is a Display (if it is a Weather type Radar) , a Transmitter / Receiver ,  Waveguide ( looks like square hollow copper tubing, conducts the radar signal ), Feed Horn (connects waveguide to antenna)  Parabolic Antenna ( Focus signal into Feed Horn)\n\nBy the wayI just remembered in the days of space travel and satelites.  When we tune in satelites the frequencies change as the satelite moves due to this doppler effect.  Now during re-entry when speeds are greater the shifts are noticeable.  And you can actually tell a difference from a ground station on the same frequency!\n\nOh yeah by the way no big problems with doppler,  except that some operator could aim the darn thing wrong I guess and single out the wrong vehicle for speeding.  Guess he would be cross eyed!!!  Mistakes happen in just about every thing that is done everywhere!  But doppler is very accurate people make mistakes.  Some few Police are true JERKS most are just humans doing their job and are actually well meaning people trying to save lives!!!!  If you feel you are unfairly stopped for speeding, now I mean you were really NOT speeding, calmly talk to the officer and just see what he can do for you.

"An associates degree usually takes 1-2 years to obtain.  Often it's two years.  A master's degree takes an additional 2 years beyond a Bachelor's degree (which takes 4 years to obtain).  Basically you could get your master's after you obtain an associates...but that would probably require 4 extra years.  Usually the order is associates (2 years), bachelors (another 2 years beyond the associates), and a masters degree (another 2 years beyond the bachelors degree)  It usually takes about 5-6 years to get a Masters.  An MS is specifically a Master's of Science degree.  Best of luck if you pursue either of those!  I have a bachelor's which took me 4 years to get.

"You can use a different lender from year to year.  For example, you can obtain your Freshman year Stafford Loan from Citizens Bank and your Sophomore year Stafford Loan from Citibank.  You will find that this is a little bit of a pain since it will entail completing a new Master Promissory Note for each lender (and might confuse your school a little bit if they are expecting you to borrow from once place and you go elsewhere).  \n\nHaving multiple lenders can benefit you, though, if you plan on consolidating later. See, students who borrow every single student loan from the same lender are bound by something known as the ""single holder rule."" Simply put, this rule states that a students with loans help by a single lender *must* consolidate with that lender.  So, if all your loans are with Citibank, you must consolidate with Citibank, even if Sallie Mae is offering better borrower benefits.\n\nNow, you probably shouldn't attempt to borrow from two Stafford lenders during the same enrollment period at the same school (for example, if you were awarded $3,500 as a Sophomore, you shouldn't attempt to borrow $1,750 from Citibank and $1,750 from Sallie Mae). While this isn't expressly forbidden, it's... well, weird and could cause a big mess (you could be responsible for an overpayment, your loan disbursements could be delayed, etc.). \n\nKeep in mind that interest rates on Stafford Loans are set by the federal government, so your underlying interest rates on any Staffords will be the same. The only reason you'd want to ""shop around"" would be to obtain one of the many ""borrower benefits"" out there for student loan borrowers (interest rate reductions, principal reductions, etc.).  However, it's unlikely that one bank will offer a benefit that's enormously better than another bank's benefit (the borrower benefits will be different, yes, but in the end, they tend to add up to similar savings).  \n\nFor more information about borrower benefits and about the ""single holder rule,"" which is still in effect, check out these pages:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/singleholderrule.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/choosing.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/calculators/loananalyzer.phtml",3
"only water weight, the only way to actually lose fat weight is by doing cardovascular exercise, so running, biking, swimming, rollerblading.  Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fruits, vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work to there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture.

"Hey do you mean Ayurveda?\n\nAyurveda (आयुर्वेद Sanskrit: ayu—life; veda—knowledge of) or ayurvedic medicine is a more than 2,000 year old comprehensive system of medicine based on a holistic approach rooted in Vedic culture. Its conspicuous use of the word veda, or knowledge, reveals its role in early Hinduism and describes its hallowed place in India. Ayurveda also had a tradition of surgery. Two early texts of Ayurveda are the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita.\n\nThe Charaka and Sushruta Samhitās are compendiums of two traditions rather than texts authored by single authors. A third tradition is that of the Kāshyapas. The scholarly traditions of ayurveda date back to the time of the Buddha, who died (mahaparinirvana) in approximately 400 BCE. Some plant remedies of ayurveda are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature 2nd millennium BC, but the formal doctrines of the three humours and other key ayurvedic ideas are first mentioned in the Buddhist Canonical literature. Both the Sushruta and Charaka Samhitās are the product of several editorial hands, having been revised and supplemented over a period of several hundred years.\n\nThe scholar Vāgbhata, who lived in Sind at the beginning of the 7th century AD, produced a grand synthesis of earlier ayurvedic materials in a verse work called Ashtānga Samhita. Another work associated with the same author, the Asthanga Samgraha, contains much the same material in a more diffuse form, written in a mixture of prose and verse. The relationship between these two works, and a third intermediate compilation, is still a topic of active research. The works of Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata are considered canonical and reverentially called the Vriddha Trayi, ""the triad of ancients""; or Brhat Trayi, ""the greater triad."" In the early eighth century, Mādhav wrote his Nidāna, a work on etiology, which soon assumed a position of authority. In the 79 chapters of this book, he lists diseases along with their causes, symptoms, and complications.\n\nThe vast majority of Ayurvedic therapies are herbal compounds. Some alchemical preparations start to enter the ayurvedic pharmacopieia towards the end of the 1st millennium AD in works such as those of Ugraditya (8th century AD)and Sarngadhara (14th century AD). It also provides therapies for the treatment of various vegetable and animal toxins like scorpion, spider and snake venom. It has a whole science of toxicology called agada-tantra as one of the eight branches of traditional Ayurveda.\n\nThe Ayurvedic idea is that the organism adapts to the environment and its food, climate etc. This principle of adaptation is called satyma. Through introducing small amounts of a food or medicine, the organism can adapt to it and learn to resist it.\n\nAyurveda became increasingly symptom-based, treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the root cause. However, it is important to note that Ayurveda was originally a consciousness based system of health care. Its philosophy, expressed in modern terms, is to strengthen the immune system.\n\n\nQualities\nIt could be said that the simple essence of ayurveda is knowledge and awareness of the qualities of nature – called gurvadi gunah. By understanding the qualities inherent in the environment, in foodstuffs, in activities, etc., one gains an appreciation of their effects on the individual constitution through the principle of similarities; i.e., that similarities cause increase while dissimilarities cause decrease. Thus hot qualities in the environment or diet will increase hot qualities in the body.\n\nThe gurvadi gunah are listed in Vagbhata's Ashtanga Hrdayam as:\n\nGuru (heavy) – laghu (light) \nManda (slow) – tikshna (quick, sharp) \nHima (cold) – ushna (hot) \nSnigdha (unctuous) – ruksha (dry) \nSlakshna (smooth) – khara (rough) \nSandra (solid) – drava (liquid) \nMrdu (soft) – kathina (hard) \nSthira (stable) – cala (mobile) \nSuk",2

Double checking the answers we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 12\nsqrt((x-4)^2 + 4^2) + sqrt((y-4)^2 + 4^2) = 12\n\nThe two solutions are therefore:\nx = 6.680915, y = 9.968218 (y is the long leg)\nx = 9.968218, y = 6.680915 (x is the long leg)\n\nIf you assume y > x, then the first solution is the only solution.",1

"#1) Everything in the universe is affected by gravity but is not held in specific locations. Objects are in motion but under the effects of gravity.\n\n#2) Gravity is a constant with a few rules to follow: the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to their mass but inversely proportional to their distance from each other. This means that object with more mass have more gravitational force but the gravity that they generate is lessened as two object move farther apart from each other.\n\nScientists speculate whether the universe will eventually succumb to the forces of gravity, causing all matter to eventually be pulled back into where the Big Bang originated, or if the Bang was sufficiently powerful, will all of the matter in the celestial bodies in the universe continue moving outward until the distance between the stars is so great that gravity can't overcome it and each galaxy is left to slowly burn out like sparks from a fireworks display?\n\nFor the last part of your question, people can walk on the Earth and on the Moon. The gravitational pull of our moon is a fraction of the Earth's pull because the moon is a fraction of the Earth's mass (remember the rules in part 1). We can't breathe on the moon because there isn't an atmosphere. The lack of an atmosphere has nothing to do with the moon's size though. It's simply due to the way the moon was formed.\n\nI hope that I was able to explain this to you properly. I'm no scientist.",1

"""actually there has been a few recorded cases of male pregnancy and men giving birth twas the inspiration behind a movie starring arnold Schwarzenegger""\n\nI disagree.  The inspiration was that some women have delivered live babies which developed outside the womb; in the peritoneal cavity.  In these cases, the placenta of the ectopic pregnancy embeds itself into the walls of various abdominal organs.\n\nThe situation is very dangerous.  Commonly, ectopic conceptions end in massive haemorrhage, long before the foetus has any chance of surviving outside the mother's body.  Her life is endangered, as the bleeding is huge, and sometimes is hard to diagnose, in time to save her life.\n\nAnyhow, there has been speculation that an embryo from IVF could grow in a man's abdomen; clearly, a uterus is not an absolute requirement.  I think no ethics board could condone such an attempt, as his life would be endangered if the pregnancy ended in haemorrhage preterm.  [Well, it would be endangered anyhow, but it is extra yukky, if the baby dies too; the usual outcome!]\n\nI suspect that a male's body would also be unable to suppress his immune system enough to avoid rejection of the foreign tissues of the conceptus.  I am not sure, but I wonder if females are better able to do this complex immunological trick!\n\nBTW, all these cases must be dealt with surgically; it is major abdominal surgery!",1

"The Ashes is a Test cricket series, played between England and Australia - it is international cricket's oldest and most celebrated rivalry dating back to 1882. It is currently played approximately biennially, alternately in England and Australia. The Ashes are ""held"" by the country which last won a series and to ""regain"" them the other country must win more Test matches in a series than the country that ""holds"" them. If a series is ""drawn"" then the country holding the Ashes retains them. The last Ashes series was played in England in 2005 when England regained The Ashes after a gap of 16 years by winning the series 2-1. The next Ashes series will be in Australia in 2006-07 and the next series in England will be in 2009.\n\nThe series is named after a satirical obituary published in The Sporting Times in 1882 following the match at The Oval, in which Australia beat England in England for the first time. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The English media dubbed the next English tour, to Australia (1882-83) as the quest to regain The Ashes.\n\nA small terracotta urn was presented to the England captain Ivo Bligh by a group of Melbourne women at some point during the 1882-83 tour. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of an item of cricket equipment, possibly a bail, ball or stump. The urn is not used as a trophy for the Ashes series, and whichever side ""holds"" the Ashes, the urn normally remains in the MCC Museum at Lord's because of its age and fragility] Since the 1998-99 Ashes series, a Waterford crystal trophy has been presented to the winners.\n\nIf you want to know more about Ashes Series, please check the following website:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes",5

Eventually it wears off, and it will wear off faster if you stay away from your ex, and put away any memories of her (especially things that smell from her scent -- odors will cause the hormone levels to rise quicker than anything else, and it will make you miserable).\n\nSo, there's both a mental and a physiological component to the situation.

"I don't think US laws favor the ""criminals"". It's just that one can never know with 100% certainty who is really guilty and who is really innocent, and that introduces a lot of human error into the process. Here are some problems with the American legal system:\n\n-Many states have different types of jail sentences, ranging from very short jail sentences for pretty serious crimes to very long sentences for relatively ""minor"" ones (such as the ""three strikes"" laws in states like Texas and California). These discrepancies mean that you might go to jail for life in Texas because you were caught a third time with a small quantity of an illicit drug but might only spend ten years for murder in one of the more liberal New England states.\n-Often, your legal counsel is nowhere near as important as jury selection. In the OJ case, for example, had the jury been majority white (as opposed to majority black) it is highly likely that OJ would have been convicted. Jury demographics matter a lot. Juries also are relatively poorly educated and have short attention spans. Studies have shown that juries are often more moved by courtroom theatrics and good-looking lawyers and defendants than they are by facts. Good-looking people tend to get more ""fair"" trials than bad looking people.  And race is also involved (white juries will be more inclined to convict a black man than a white one).\n-The Supreme Court has shifted from a more liberal stance to a more conservative one. For example, while the liberal Court of the 1960s and 1970s gave us ""Miranda"" rights, the more conservative Rehnquist Court has tended to side with police and law enforcement. Whereas a defendant might once have gotten off the hook if evidence was obtained without a warrant or if a legal ""technicality"" was breached, nowadays the courts give a lot more leeway to law enforcement (for example, police might come to a person's house with a warrant to search for illegal firearms and arrest a person on the possession of illicit drugs- even if drugs were not specified in the warrant). With the Patriot Act and now wire tapping, the Federal givernment has immensely expanded its ability to search individuals without court warrants.  It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will weigh in on these measures and whether or not it will deem them un-Constitutional.",9

In about 6 months, you will know more than all of the books put together. So don't sweat it. It just is not that important.\n\nNo, you do not need a business plan. Whoever told you that you needed one is wrong. Business plans are primarily used to get financing from a bank, which you are not going to get for a service business. Since this is only going to be a micro busniess venture, you will spend more time updating your spreadsheets than using the plan. Since you plan on transitioning from a full-time job to this, you are set financially. Don't let this bogus requirement get you down.\n\nYou do need a marketing plan. For your business, I would strongly recommend Guerilla Marketing by Jay Conrad Levinson. Pick a few marketing techniques that you are comfortable with and go at it. Just off the top of my head, I would have business cards, web site, stationery, flyers, and attend networking events. Your potential clients should include salesman (notoriously disorganized), real estate agents, insurance agents, independent consultants, and executives who want an assistant but their company won't let them hire one directly. You want to be marketing regularly. Again, GM by Levinson is perfect for you.\n\nIf I was looking for a virtual assistant, I would only be interested in references and a client list. Having stated that, your first priority should be to define what exactly you are willing to do? Payroll, travel arrangements, online research, telemarketing, etc.  Once you have an idea of what you will do, I would make up a cost sheet and a list of references. Since you do not have any clients, use personal references. The only other question I have that your clients would share is how well are you going to help me when you have a full-time job.\n\nAlthough I do not use VA's, I know small business owners that swear by them. I also know that there were times when I was stuck in an airport that I would have loved having someone to call  who could get me the hell out of there or arrange a hotel or something.  \n\nBest of luck to you.",6

"All the previous answers are correct. However, with regards to enthalpy and entropy remember what these terms mean. While enthalpy is heat energy, entropy is (essentially) a universal tendency towards chaos. So, hydrophobic interactions decrease the total enthalpy of a system and (according to some fundamental physics) increase the entropy of that same system. The apparent paradox, proteins and lipids forming ordered systems IE. micelles, is disproven when we take into account the ordering of water around these systems. Water molecules become MUCH less ordered when hydrophobic components are allowed to form contacts. This is known as decreasing the hydration shell. Thus, all hydrophobic interactions are typically exothermic in nature and cause an increase in enthalpy of the system. Hope this helps!",1

You share an acquaintance. It is used when you have been referred to the enterprise by someone reputable. Make sure that you mention the person's name within the first paragraph of your letter. It is also called the network letter. Always try to get a referrer because it enhances the possibility of getting the job. \n\nReport back cover letter It is also called a follow-up on a previous letter or interview. It may seem desperate but if your wording is correct, it can show determination and attention to detail. It works the same as following up on a sales lead and brings your application to the attention of the recruiter. Use this letter three or more days after an interview to show your interest, highlight skills, and to thank the recruiter for the interview. Try to mention skills and experience that you may have missed during an interview. Do not repeat the information from your first cover letter.

"In the quran teaches very different from the bible in translation to jinn. It states that jinn are NOT fallen angels. They were created from a smokeless flame of fire.

It teaches that you must distance yourself from them. Jinn can be delivered from evil and become Muslim.  It is possible to have relations with them, but don't to it. It also mentions fortune-teller soothsayer jinn that they can play mind games with you.

"I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do).

If you don't want them for yourself, give them to a charity or something- there are a million causes that would not care if they got pennies. Who are we that we can toss pennies away- giive to someone who needs it!\n\nanother tidbit of info for you:\n\nFrom the following website: WWW.TREASURY.GOV--\n\nAre there any plans to remove the one-cent coin (more popularly known as the ""penny”) from circulation?\n\n You may be interested to know that the penny is the most widely used denomination currently in circulation and it remains profitable to make. Significantly, it is Congress that determines the denominations of coins that the Mint must produce and put into circulation. Each penny costs .81 of a cent to make, but the United States Mint collects one cent for it. The profit goes to help fund the operation of the United States Mint and to help pay the public debt. In 2000, this profit added up to about $24 million. As the United States Mint produces the coins that Congress mandates, it does not have the authority to abolish a unit of currency. If directed to do so by legislation enacted by the Congress and signed by the President, the Treasury Department would again study phasing out the penny. Because the demand exists and the Federal Reserve Banks require inventories to meet the demand, the United States Mint is committed to producing the penny.",6

"It's a good thing you don't want just a one or two line response; it's never quite that easy.\n\nFirst, it comes from a sense on the part of al-Qaeda that the U.S. is the ""Great Satan.""  What initially set these guys off was when the U.S. deployed to Saudi Arabia to fight Iraq in 1991.  The mudjaheddin believed they should be the ones fighting the Iraqis -forgetting that most of their weapons & support came from the U.S. anyway.  Being passed over in favor of the U.S. was a big irritant.\n\nSo, because of what amounts to a huge inferiority complex, they felt (and still feel) the need to hurt the U.S.  After the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, the disaster in Mogadishu, the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa, and the USS Cole attack, they figured the U.S. didn't have the guts to use force against them, beyond firing a couple of cruise missiles which may or may not have done anything serious besides blow up an aspirin factory in Sudan.\n\nThe Clinton administration didn't do anything to disabuse them of this notion; to their credit, mustering the kind of support needed would have been difficult in general, and impossible under his key supporters.  After several years of planning, 19 terrorists hijacked four airliners, and we all know the rest.\n\nPart of this was hoping that the U.S. would invade Afghanistan and then al-Qaeda could somehow cause the country's collapse.  Why did they think this?  Because, less than two years after the end of the Soviet occupation, the Soviet Union collapsed.  Any serious student of international relations knows, of course, that such thinking is, to say the least, deeply flawed, but that's what they thought.  Al-Qaeda also believed that we would deploy tanks & infantry and do what the Soviets did, assuming, of course, we would even have the will to fight, which he didn't believe we had.  So, what did happen came as a major surprise.\n\nHonestly, if anyone thinks that someone else caused 9/11, they're crazy.  Al-Qaeda did it after failing to blow it up in 1993.",9

I believe the only way to cause a metal to combine with oxygen would require an electric or flame arc to vaporize the material and have enough oxygen present to ""burn metal."" \n\nON THE OTHER HAND, it was a widely used practice in the later WWII and cold war days to check radar operation by chucking welding rods in front of the radar beam and watch them flash into non-existence like a flashbulb.  The rod would be instantly changed to plasma and burn with the air.  I think if your definition of eddy current includes the current produced in a high energy RF electromagnetic field, then YES, it CAN burn metal.  Radar tubes back in the day could be in the thousands to 1 megawatt range, which would instanly destroy any metallic or RF conductive object (bird) if it got close enough to the emitter.  If you put a crinkled piece of aluminum foil in your microwave, the edges will flash and burn from the eddy currents induced by the conduction of the RF energy from the magnetron in the oven.  \n\nEddy currents, however, are usally NOT associated with arcs.  Eddy currents usually apply to tranformer and motor designs where electromagnets are formed with sheet steel and have windings which generate the magnetic field.  Transformer laminations are insulated from one another to PREVENT eddy currents which are very high amperage, low voltage currents induced in the armatures or cores of transformers when magnetic fields alternate in the core.  If a 60 Hz transformer, say for an old amplifier, were made of a solid block, it would waste a lot of power in the core itself because of the eddy currents.  If you construct the core with laminated sheets, the eddy currents cannot flow from sheet to sheet, so you make a more efficient design. \n\nI hope this helps.",1

"I had my appendix out several years ago. You dont see anything of the operating room, or anything scary. When you get taken for the operation, you enter a plain room when you are sedated. It is very quick and simple. You fall asleep very quickly. You dont know anything about having the operation and it feels that as soon as you fall asleep they are waking you up. You dont dream at all. \n\nAfter the operation, you will be on strong painkillers for a few days. You wont be able to sit up as easy as normal, but just roll onto your side and push yourself up. Using your stomach muscles will hurt for a while. You will be well looked after. There is nothing to worry about. These operations happen many times a day and all turn out fine.\n\nDont worry, and make the most of the attention and people waiting on you hand and foot. ;-)",2

"An increase in pressure causes the boiling point to go up. Think about it like this, at higher pressures, the molecules will be pushed closer together, to the point where intermolecular attractions become significant and the vapor condenses to form a liquid. It takes more energy (i.e. higher temperature) to allow the molecules to break free into the gas phase.\n\nThis is also why the boiling point of water is less at high elevations; there's less pressure, so it's easier to make water boil.\n\nAnother thing to note: The boiling point is defined as the point where the vapor pressure of the substance equals the surrounding pressure. Since vapor pressures generally increase with increasing temperature, an increase in surrounding pressure raises the temperature needed to maintain that equality.",1

"Some bacteria are harmless. Your skin, mouth, bowels and other places are filled with them. Many are even necessary to your survival because they help digest food or keep infectious organisms at bay. Cows could not digest grass without bacteria in their stomachs. The troublemakers are the ones that are able to make harmful chemicals that act like acids or poisons. Botulism, for instance, is caused by a bacterial poison. Pus, for the most part, is the body's response to illness. It's a collection of white cells that the body recruits for an area of infection. At other times, bacteria are so irritating to your system that your own body's defenses go overboard and attack not only the bacteria but also the tissues that host them.\n\nHow do I know I have a bacterial infection?\n\nBacterial infection usually makes you noticeably sick, whether it's an infected ingrown toenail or bloody diarrhea. Sometimes, however, they produce very little awareness but still can go on to cause immense trouble. Sexually transmitted disease, for instance, can be very subtle and can leave you infertile before you know what hit you. Even if an infection is obvious, it often takes a modern laboratory to identify the exact germ and, more important, tell the doctor what to use to treat it. Most bacteria can be grown in the laboratory and tested for their reaction to different antibiotics. This is why the doctor wants to collect a specimen from your infection, wherever it is.\n\nMany infections produce inflammation, a process generated mostly by your immune system, which appears as redness from an increased blood supply, swelling from fluid accumulating in the tissues, pain from nerve irritation, and heat, both localized warmth and generalized fever.",2
