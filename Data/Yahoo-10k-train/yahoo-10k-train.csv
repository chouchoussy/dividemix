0,"Hyphey is its own branch of hip-hop/rap/whatever you want to call it, that has its roots in the San Francisco/Bay area.  It was a sort of backlash against all the gangster rap, and the negativity and violence that went along with that.  Hyphey is its own culture, with its own music, and its own terminology.  There are some odd seeming rituals, such as ""ghosting,"" where people all get out of a car, and let it idle slowly down the street, while they walk along side--it looks as no one is driving the car because no one is--or its being driven by a ghost.  The culture has a lot to do with partying, love, support of friendships, bonds, and seeking a high or euphoria not so much from alcohol or drug use (but that is still quite part of it,) but more from the experience itself.  It really is in many ways, sort of a very modern, rap-like resurrection of the hippy life-style, or at least those ideals.  There are some excellent articles on the internet if you are a reader.  Sorry I don't have the links saved, but they come up easily under searches."
0,"Hello friend,\nBashing religions are very common these days and while I think the question you posted is not actually a question and more like a comment on religion, I would like to talk about it.\n\nWe usually forget to make difference between the religion and the follower of that religion, for example if my sister can't drive and I hand her my brand new car and she crashes it, am I supposed to blame the car company for not making a crash proof car and call it a ""no good"" car?\n\nIf you want to know about religions then pickup the scriptures and read them and then decide what is wrong and what is not.\n\n2nd common thing I have noticed in religion bashers is that they say ""religion brought all the violence to the human kind"". I say, if the religions are really this bad then name few civilizations that existed in the past which were not violent and were successful.\nI on the other hand can provide you a great list of civilizations from the past that were religious AND were successful.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the most violent time for human on this earth started right after the Darwinism which pointed directly and indirectly about human races differences are actually part of evolution where whites with blond hair and blue eyes are most superior kind of human evolution. \nNo wonder Hitler had ranches where he was ""breeding"" the superior humans for his army.\n\nAnother common practice I have noticed from religion bashers is they either posses no (complete) knowledge and know about only one religion and based on that, they claim all religions are evil.\nJust because one or 2 religions are nonsense doesn't grants one authority of labeling all religions. Pickup the scriptures and spend some time with them. Ask questions, find answers, counter-question those answers.\nIf one can spend 28 years to become a doctor and must follow the text in order to become a good doctor then what is wrong with picking up a book for that may help you become a better human being?\n\nI personally am a Muslim and the reason behind it that I asked questions and found answers. I have studied Bible, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsi and Islamic scripture and then picked what I believed to be helpful for me to become a better human being for myself, the people around me and the people in this world.\n\nI hope you will open up your heart and try to understand where I am coming from."

0,"""According to astronomers, the Earth should last for at least five billion more years before the sun becomes a red giant. Due to the sun's loss of mass the Earth would escape to an orbit at a further distance than its current orbit. The immense heat however would likely boil off the oceans and turn the Earth into a barren wasteland looking like Mars does. If the Earth survived this event, the sun would further evolve into a white dwarf and provide too little heat to sustain life.""\n\nNormally I don't copy and paste but Wikipedia explained that a lot better than I could've. I guess the ""five billion years"" estimate is assuming that some other catastrophe doesn't happen in the meantime, like an asteroid impact or human-created disaster or anything like that. But if none of that happens, Earth will be here for a while yet."

0,Hi! The Day Of Silence is a day were everyone that supports Gays decide to be quiet for a whole day. The reason they do this is to support those unfurtunate people who cannot come out and say how they feel inside due to discrimination from families and society. We decide to be quiet just like them so people can know that its not just one or a couple of people that stay silent for a long period of there life pretending to be someone their not.

0,"NO, NO\n\nWhat is the origin of the Trinity doctrine?\nThe New Encyclopædia Britannica says: “Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Old Testament: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord’ (Deut. 6:4). . . . The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies. . . . By the end of the 4th century . . . the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since.”Micropædia, Vol. X, p. 126.\nThe New Catholic Encyclopedia states: “The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma. Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”\nIn The Encyclopedia Americana we read: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person]. The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one. Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on the contrary, a deviation from this teaching\nDoes the Bible agree with those who teach that the Father and the Son are not separate and distinct individuals?\nMatt. 26:39, RS: “Going a little farther he [Jesus Christ] fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.’” (If the Father and the Son were not distinct individuals, such a prayer would have been meaningless. Jesus would have been praying to himself, and his will would of necessity have been the Father’s will.)\nJohn 8:17, 18, RS: “[Jesus answered the Jewish Pharisees:] In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.” (So, Jesus definitely spoke of himself as being an individual separate and distinct from the Father.)\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\nCol. 1:15, 16, RS: “He [Jesus Christ] is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; for in him all things were created, in heaven and on earth.” In what sense is Jesus Christ “the first-born of all creation”? \n, the expression “the firstborn of” occurs upwards of 30 times in the Bible, and in each instance that it is applied to living creatures the same meaning applies—the firstborn is part of the group. “The firstborn of Israel” is one of the sons of Israel; “the firstborn of Pharaoh” is one of Pharaoh’s family; “the firstborn of beast” are themselves animals.\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty?\nMark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. So the truth here stated applies to the relationship between God and Christ in heaven.)\nDoes the Bible teach that each of those said to be part of the Trinit"

0,"There is no ( or at the very least, precious little) evidence of a person called Jesus outside of the bible.  Xians will say Josephus mentioned him, but in fact, the only translation we have of Josephus was done by a christian writer in the 4th century...we don't have it in the original Latin.  And what is mentioned is very weak and open to interpretation and very likely was subject to interpolation.\n\nThe Romans were meticulous record keepers.  If Jesus existed, and had fostered the kind of revolution that would get their attention by threatening Roman rule, performing miracles, there would be copious writings about him from the Romans, and other sources.\n\nPaul the Apostle is agreeably the earliest christian writer, and he wrote probably a couple decades after the putative events.  Yet Paul makes no reference to a recently living Christ...and if you read his works separate from the rest of the NT, he seems to be writing of a supernatural creature who fought a battle, died and rose again in a spiritual realm, eons ago.  Paul went to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and yet he makes no mention of a pilgramage to Golgotha, or the tomb or any sites that would be shrines to a real person recently living, crucified and risen again ascending into heaven. Paul is bizarrely disinterested in anything relating to a real physical Jesus.\n\nAll other accounts, were written much later.  The earliest Gospel of Mark (by the way, it wasn't written by anybody called Mark, it is anonymous) couldn't have been written any earlier than 40-50 years after the events.  The Gospels all contradict each other as to Jesus life, miracles and death.  I recommend any of Randall Helms books on the New Testament and Gospels for a detailed overview of the problems.\n\nIt really is quite interesting if you are prepared to have an open mind about it.  Jesus, if he existed, was at best a wandering prophet/holyman/philospher.  We have lots of legendary heroes with stories about them, like King Arthur, William Tell...but we know they never actually existed.  I think it more likely he never actually existed, and was created as a ""founding father"" in the heroic tradition by the early church."

0,"it's largely due to christian hate.\n\nchristians are preoccupied with a need to hate people.\n\nfor example, the moron above named Doc seems to think that being gay is a choice, so that makes some ""difference"" in a civil rights issue.\n\nif that was the case, then NO conscious choice we make would be protected.  but, religion and the freedom to choose your religious preference is protected under the constitution.  it's a choice that people make and often change during their lives.  and that is constitutionally protected as a civil right.\n\nbut most morons like Doc cannot think past their bibles and their religious/christian hate for others.  and those are the truly evil, hateful people in the world.  Doc is typical of the american christian who is preoccupied with what all american consenting adults do with their penises and vaginas at home.  he probably paces back and forth at home, on his 1972 orange shag carpet, wringing his hands and sweating, thinking and agonizing about all the male penises having sexual contact with other males all over the country...maybe even right next door to him!!  oh my goodness!!!!\n\n(PS - sexual orientation is not a choice.  but the point i made above is, even if it was a choice, it must still be a protected civil right...protected especially from those who choose christianity and choose to hate others.)"

0,"Simple answer is Prohibition.  To explain a little more it is because hops, one of the main flavoring elements in beer is only used for one thing, and that is beer.  During Prohibition hops were not readily available since they were only used for making beer.  Beer was still brewed during Prohibition, it was just lightly hopped or not hopped at all.  Since that was all there was to drink was ""wee"" then that is what America drank.  After Prohibition was abolished people were used to drinking ""wee"" and that is what the factories produced.\n\nAnother reason for bad American beers is because they try to sell a cheap product so instead of using all malted barley they use adjuncts like corn and rice to cheapen the cost, and thus the lack of flavor."

Jesus said, ""Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.""  John 10:16.  He was talking about true believers in Christ, no matter where they are found.  He is bringing them into one fold with one shephard, which is Jesus Christ, not a man representing him.  It is true that if the head is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, but doesn't mean God still can't find sheep there and bring them out. Some have never made a commitment to Jesus Christ, but Christ's Holy Spirit is still influencing their heart toward him and will eventually be in that number when Jesus his people.  There are those who say they are born again Christians but will find themself outside heaven, because just counted one that one time experience, and falsely thinking that was all it took to get to heaven.  They never took the time to know him or serve him.  Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

0,"I just had this conversation yesterday with my mother, what a coincidence. As someone who works in the childcare field, I feel really sad by the lack of men in this line of work. I feel that men have a lot to offer to children, especially children who may come from split homes and lack a male influence. It's interesting how people assume that about men, but not about women. They assume that men are born to be sex fiends, and women are born to be nurturers... well anyone with a brain knows that it doesn't work that way.\n\nMy heart goes out to you, I'm sure you get a lot of flack from people and that it's extremely frustrating. I remember a couple of guys in our program at school who actually dropped out, not because they didn't enjoy it, but because they were tired of being called perverts. \n\nPeople are paranoid and want to protect their children, that's a natural instinct. But assuming a man who works with children is a pedophile/molester is NOT healthy, and it makes me wonder how they're bringing up their children. And of course, those same people need to be reminded that there isn't a strong correlation between homosexuality and child molestation - male child molesters are more likely to molest little girls, often members of their family.\n\nBest Regards,\nHolly"

0,"I'm a grammar tyrant so think I should firstly correct two mistakes in your statement.  It's country's (singular noun with possessive apostrophe s) and cultures' (plural noun with possessive apostrophe after the s).\n\nI think part of the problem is that spelling is no longer taught in schools.  Additionally, the English language is still developing with new words and variations being added to the dictionary every day.  I'm English and cringe when I see non UK ""english"" in texts but understand that is how other countries spell words - eg, humor instead of humour - I don't like it but that's the way it is.\n\nThe use of ""qk txt 4 mbl fn txts"" has also caused a deterioration in spelling.  Add to this the fact that many TV presenters presenting programmes aimed at children say things such as ""much worser"" rather than ""much worse"" or just ""worse"" and this teaches a new generation bad habits.  My old english teacher said that it's easier to spell a word if you pronounce it correctly - take ""inspector"" - if people spelt it the way some people say it they'd spell it ""inspecter"".  Teach children to speak properly and they will spell properly - this doesn't mean the destruction of regional accents and everyone reverting to old BBC English, just the ability to include the letters T and H in words.\n\nWell, that's my rant for the time being.

The fact is there are tendancies in all races  but to say that that is  the only color to do them is absurd. I find most racists are people who either havent grown up around other races or have grown up around them and got hurt by the situations. You also have teh ones who havent amounted to to much in society's eyes and they turn to the opposite race and say things that you would think hmmm.....""are they looking in the mirror"".

0,"Hi, and what an interesting question!  My ex-fiance is a player.  We dated for almost 6 years....now, after being broken up for nearly 5 years, he is, yet again, and engaged, yet again.  Here's what I noticed in his ""player"" personality.  A lot of it had to do with how he acted and treated me when we first started dating......he made sure he let me know I was the only woman in his heart (although dropped hints that his friends were #1)...he would pay attention, only when birthdays and holidays arrived, as to what truly made me happy, so that his present and attitude would rise him to the top....he would always bring me around his friends....other women would always flirt with him and although he would flirt back, he seemed to be more interested in me and that's all that mattered...but I think the best answer to this question is not details of the man, or boy, himself, but the woman who chooses to be with him.  My lack of self-confidence, insecurity and immaturity drew me closer to him because he paid attention to me and no matter what he did, how he responded to my concerns, or how he treated me, he still called me his girlfriend, still showed affection and still called me for everything he needed...so, it made me feel important when in reality, he was self-centered, greedy and cocky and never truly thought about me.

The origins of the name were originally created when Protestant Professor Andreas Helwig in 1612 tried to convert the title of the Pope into Roman numerals equivalent to 666.

0,"Well the amount of money in taxes would certainly be a major factor....it's also arguable that crime on one hand would be significantly reduced for obvious reasons (decriminalisation) but then again would there be an increase in users and therefore crime related to obtaining money for these drugs??

A combination of selling certain drugs through licenced premises and a liberalisation of trade barriers for certain substances could actually benefit certain drug production for some of the world's poorest people.\n     It has been proved with the lowering of cannabis to grade C that usage has actually dropped....maybe an effect of making it less desirable as it doesn't carry the same position in youngsters minds (demand dropping when level of legality falls).

I think when Yahshua took the gospel to the Gentiles(Europeans) most spoke Greek and since Paul was a Greek speaker and he was the apostle to the Gentiles maybe that why we only have it in Greek, So that the Greeks could teach others about the Gospel.

As dusk grew close Polyphemus returned, again rolling back the boulder and letting in his flock. He then caught two more Greeks, killed them and ate them raw. After consuming both men he spoke to Odysseus asking, ""what is your name"", Odysseus' reply was ""Outis"" (in Greek this means ""nobody""). As part of the plan, Odysseus offered Polyphemus a full goatskin of wine and when he had finish the last drop, and feeling a little drunk, Polyphemus fell fast asleep. This was the time to take action, Odysseus and four of his men brought out the pole, which they had sharpened, and with one great thrust plunged the point into Polyphemus' eye, pushing it deep, to ensure it made him totally blind. The agonizing pain made Polyphemus scream out, so loud in fact that it brought the neighboring Cyclopes to see what was wrong.

0,"Though I would disagree with the statement as written, what it means is as follows:\n\nDuring a period of church history known as The Protestant Reformation, the Lutheran Church as we know it broke away from The Roman Catholic Church.  A fellow by the name of Martin Luther (not to be confused with the more recent activist Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.) had famously nailed 95 theses to the door of the church.  These theses were intellectual challenges of certain church practices and dogma.  While this may sound like a bold move, in truth there was little all that flamboyant about it.  Church doors in that place and time were also used as community bulletin boards and many people nailed notices and documents to them the way we post bills in urban areas today.  The 95 theses were little more than 95 topics of discussion for debate he'd hoped to bring attention to.  Martin Luther never had the notion of beginning a new form of the Christian religion.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy of the questions dealt with the then Roman Catholic Church practice of selling indulgences.  This was a transitive notion that depending on where one was either got enforced as an abuse to a large degree or got used as a quick little means of acceptance.  That's to say that people who paid the church money got absolution for sins from clergy right away, something Roman Catholics believe is necessary to enter the kingdom of heaven.  It was a practice that dated back hundreds of years in different forms and that segregated those who could pay from those who could not as if sin was a matter of barter.  Martin Luther wished to debate the practice, perhaps even eliminate it.\n\nWell, having gone so strictly against church policy, the simple questions turned into a grandiose argument that sent ripples through the Christian world without end.  The church was just too powerful to fight.  Martin Luther received the brunt of the fallout.  However, it wasn't until an almost unrelated incident, years later, when a reigning Pope excommunicated the entire nation of Germany from the church, that the people there rose up and basically said, ""Hey, we don't need your church, we can follow the teachings of this guy over here, Martin Luther.""  All of a sudden Luther's questions and assertions had followers.  They built their own churches, patterned after what they knew from Roman Catholicism.  They acquired their own clergy and a few practices that differed slightly from RC but ultimately fell in line with what Martin Luther had pointed out.  Though not the Protestant religion, Lutherans had much to do with the protestant movement (Protestant Reformation), a second schism away from the church after the Great Schism had divided the RC church into Eastern and Western centuries earlier..\n\nAttending a Lutheran church ceremony differs little from a Roman Catholic ceremony in the same season.  There are usually fewer images of Christ and saints, prefering a simple cross and a greater focus on the WORD.  Roman Catholics recognize seven practices as sacraments while Lutherans recognize only five.  Many of the songs are exactly the same, but sung to different tunes.  The Lutheran hierarchy goes up to bishops or so while the Roman Catholic hierarchy extends all the way to the Pope.  Lutheran churches tend to be a little smaller.  Roman Catholics traditionally go to Confession in a dark and quiet private booth called a Confessional while Lutherans tend to simply confess all their sins in a single, common sentence during part of the ceremony.  Both believe in pretty much the same versions of Christ's story and both have similar formats of services.  There’s an academic question over transubstantiation, but one of little note to a person practicing neither religion.\n\nIn recent years, post Vatican II, the similarities between the two have gotten even closer to the naked eye.  That's to say that the Roman Catholic Church has extended c"

0,"Yes because Jesus died to save all of us for our sins.\nHomosexuality is considered a sin in the Bible, but so is mistreating your wife, or (seriously) whereing cotton and polyester on the sabbath day, or pre-marital sex, all of which are far more common in American culure. Besides, ""being"" a gay person isn't sinful, it's the act of (and I quote) ""a man lieing with another man, and he would a woman"" that the Bible condems. Homosexuals have been exploited and made fun of ever since conservatives found out they were fighting a losing battle after Roe v. Wade. Republicans need someone to villanize, and in today's society, homosexuals are that someone. Forgive them, for they no not what they do.\n\nby the way, there is only one line about homosexuality in the bible, and another line that talks about the first one. one in the new testament, and one in the old.\n\non the other hand, there are several scores of lines about the sin of ""JUDGING OTHERS!"" so as far as sin goes, if you're a morally just homosexual, you're a lot better than a republican who condemns you as sinful and immoral.\n\nfurthermore, the bible makes it clear that men lieing with men (i suppose that'd go for women w/ women too) is an abomination against GOD, not against humanity, so no one has any right to judge you. and if they do, well then, i guess the devil will have to make a special new torture chamber designed especially for them (or not, they'll be in heaven to, God is forgiving of all people).\n\ngod bless you."

0,"In meditation, we try to develop wisdom, learn to observe our own mind, decrease negative mind states and develop positive mind states. To develop wisdom and insight, we need a calm, clear and concentrated mind. To observe our own mind, we need to develop a kind of inner ""spy"" - a part of our attention that checks our state of mind. To decrease negative mind states we need to understand where they come from and transform them into positive energy with the wisdom developed from observing our own mind. To develop positive mind states, we need to focus away from selfishness and again develop wisdom by observing our own mind.\nAs you may realise from the above, we should actually become our own psychologist, or like the title of a booklet by Lama Yeshe: ""Becoming Your Own Therapist"".\n\nIn order to find the right state of mind for meditation, we need concentration instead of being scattered, and clarity of mind instead of dullness. We need to observe our own thoughts and mind states instead of getting lost in emotions or becoming prejudiced. We need to be honest towards ourselves instead of fooling ourselves and walk away from unpleasant problems. Furthermore, we need to be patient (one does not become a meditation master over night), generate self-acceptance, confidence and enthusiasm to make the mind peaceful.\nAll these factors need to be in balance: we need to be somewhat relaxed as well as concentrated, we need to avoid both sleepiness and excitement. \n\nIn Buddhism, the continuum of the mind has no beginning or end but changes moment by moment.\n\nthat said, meditation alone don't bring enlightenment."

0,"Wow sorry about your perception, allow me to change a few things, as i did not intend to seem hateful.\n\n most Christians believe that where God is absent, evil lies. Do i mean this to you directly? well, lets say i reviewed your Q&A and 360 before my post. You basically say you are demon possessed.  Does this mean that you have absence of God in your life, yes i believe so, so im just im just sharing a common general belief there right? no need to feel defensive, honestly.  We could all be closer to God.\nsecondly here i write,\n\n""You poor thing, you have serious issues, its no wonder, you wont let the true LOrd Hold you and save you and coddle you and share his peace and love with you, well how can you expect to be nurtured? and grow into the wonderful being that he planned for you?""\nHave you pushed the Lord away? I know you have, and  I want you to know that you can have all of the above if you let Him in. Does a part of me tell myself that you need that? Yes it does. I see you as hurting. and let me say on a kind gentle note, you dont have to, there are better ways than the sarcastics stated below.\n\n""Now go alienate yourself from all that is Good, take the EASY way; without question,listen to the LIES, deny the ache and stench in your heart, youll feel much more comfortable im sure.

They sugar coat crap all the time to get the desired outcome, and this too does not come from God.\n\nI hope and pray you have good in you, but isnt that difficult with the demon ruling and all? doesnt he want to make it all about you? if that part of you can undertand good is still in there, bring it out sister, Get strong, and fight, do you realize what bondage you are in?  If you dont think its that easy its because your head is filled with lies.\nI, pregowtwins promise never to fill someones head with lies or spew hatred, but do you know that?\nI wont however pity you or speak  to you condescendingly. You are not a baby, and I (nor was Jesus for that matter), not a pushover.\n\n\n""look at the answerer above me, awww, how true and heartfelt are his comments, he could surely be your best friend.""\n\nwell thats just as clear to day as me.

0,"talisman   n. pl. talismans \n1.An object marked with magic signs and believed to confer on its bearer supernatural powers or protection. \n2.Something that apparently has magic power. \n\nA talisman is also know as a amulet (ăm′ yəlĭt), object or formula that credulity and superstition have endowed with the power of warding off harmful influences. The use of the amulet to avert danger and to dispel evil has been known in different religions and among diverse peoples. Like the talisman and the charm, the amulet is believed to be the source of an impersonal force that is an inherent property of the object rather than the manifestation of a deity working through that object (see fetish and taboo). Although amulets are most often worn on the body, hanging from the neck or strapped to the arm or leg, they may also serve as protective emblems on walls and doorways (e.g., the Jewish mezuzah). Sometimes the amulet consists of a spoken, written, or drawn magic formula, such as abracadabra and the magic square, or of a symbolic figure, such as the wheel of the sun god and the Aryan swastika. In many cultures the teeth, claws, and other parts of an animal are believed to communicate their properties to the wearer. Although belief in amulets is very widespread in primitive societies, it has survived in modern civilization. Common superstition has endowed such things as the rabbit's foot with the property of being able to bring good luck. In some modern religious practices, amulets such as the Jewish phylactery and the Christian cross are more strictly related to ritual and serve as personal reminders to the wearers of their relationship to God."

Many of them say the playwright doesn't exist, but then someone shows up named Christianson, claiming to be Christian writing himself into the play.

0,"In the past, there was a Ch'an master who had three disciples. One day, two of them got into a heated argument. One of them went to the Master, stated his case and asked if he was right or not. The Master replied: ""Yes, you are right."" The monk then went back outside and told the other two monks. The other monk who had participated in the argument didn't believe him and went to see the Master himself. After stating his argument, the Master told him that he was correct. Upon hearing this the third monk was confused, thinking it's impossible that both monks are right. Thereupon, he also went to see the Master and asked: ""Isn't one right and the other wrong."" The Master replied: ""Yes, you are right."" The three monks then went to see the master to ask how it was possible for all three of them to be right. Had he made a mistake? No, all of them had been right.\nThis story illustrates that it is meaningless to get into any kind of argument. In this world, there is no absolute truth. From the Buddhist point of view everything in the world is impermanent and conditioned and therefore can only be considered from a comparative or relative point of view. When we judge one thing to be better than another we always do so from a relative or comparative standpoint. The Enlightened mind, which sees things as they really are, does not attach to any particular thing as being the absolute truth nor does it reject any particular thing as not being the absolute truth."

0,"Advertising will never be banned because the same people who advertise on TV pay the TV companies huge amounts of money to do so and also I think that if it were banned you would find your TV license would become even more extortionate than it is at the moment. I do agree however that the type of advertising we are subjected to needs amending as the one you cite is particularly sexist...then again some food adverts can be just as damaging but potentially physically rather than psychologically.\n\nAnyway, if people truly object to advertising then they have the option to not watch TV and instead read a book."

They vibrate on a much higher frequency and require energy to materialize. Some can only do it partially. Some mediums offer their own energy to help the entities materialize. Seances use group energy. This is why the room gets cold, from the energy being used by the entity.\nBy the way, all you reincarnation believers: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

It's just that today, as compared with the 1950s, say, we have such a marvelous communications network that you hear about the weirdos.  And if they account for, say, 1 in one-hundred thousand people, there are so many more people now than there were in the 1950s that of course any subset of that population is now much bigger.  The US population in the 50s was around 150 million, and now exceeds 250 million, so we have a hundred million more people, which means 1000 extra weirdos using the non-scientic guess for weirdo-rate I cited above.

0,"A nut with little or no formal training \n\nParapsychology is the study of certain types of paranormal phenomena (parapsychology comes from the Greek para, “beside, beyond,” + psychology, derived from the Greek psyche, “soul, mind,” + logos “rational discussion”). The term was coined by Max Dessoir (1889). J. B. Rhine adopted it to refer to the scientific study of paranormal phenomena which are manifestations of psi.A ccording to The Parapsychological Association, an organization affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science[4], parapsychological phenomena can be categorized thus:\n\nThese [paranormal] anomalies fall into three general categories: ESP[...] [Extra-Sensory Perception], PK [Psychokinesis], and phenomena suggestive of survival after bodily death, including near-death experiences, apparitions, and reincarnation. Most parapsychologists today expect that further research will eventually explain these anomalies in scientific terms, although it is not clear whether they can be fully understood without significant (some might say revolutionary) expansions of the current state of scientific knowledge. Other researchers take the stance that existing scientific models of perception and memory are adequate to explain some or all parapsychological phenomena."

0,"That depends. Its not immoral to be sexually active with a consenting partner who is legally and ethically able to give consent. It would be immoral to do that with someone other than the person you have promised to be faithful to. \n\nI do believe repressed feelings can lead to a variety of ills and in some cases, say you are holding back a feeling of anger with a desire to rape, you need professional intervention to help to keep you from harming others. \n\nHere's an example. Say you are the male minister of a church and you are married to a female. To her you have promised to be faithful, however that is a promise that you are not able to keep because you are actually not heterosexual. So you lie and cheat and seek out what you are truly attracted to, your own gender. That is an immoral situation, not because you are seeking out your own gender but because although the relationship you are having with your own gender is consentual and you are both of an age to be able to give consent, you are lying to someone else that you have promised to only be with. However that is not evil, its simple immorality. \n\nNow say your level of self hatred about your true nature is so intense that not only do you lie and cheat, but you also spread your self hatred into society at large, targeting those who's very nature you share. Your work to discriminate against and cause emotional and psychological harm to a particular group of society by its nature is evil because its based on your repressed feelings and not on the public reasons you state. In your repression of your true self, you have made a ministry of repressing others."

0,"Jim im just reading the link that Nikki posted and here is a quote for that page: \n\n""The education system teaches children not to think. Any student that uses logic and solid scientific evident to question the Theory of Evolution is ridiculed and insulted into submission. The students that submit become non thinking robots that dare not question the dogma presented.""\n\nHuh? Dont you think that they are turning they're own problems of illogical thought on to us as they are trying to grasp some form of reason as to why they should continue to believe? \n\nOh and another on that made me chuckle\n\n""A forth grade elementary school class was observed at the park playing a three-legged race game. The kids thought it was great fun. The teacher told them they were being trained to cooperate. Actually it was brainwashing kids into conforming to the system where they are not allowed to have individual thoughts or opinions.""\n\nObviously doesnt understand what gene mutations are and that they are not neccesiarly a change for the better. Also dogs.....\n\n"" The process of natural selection is not an evolutionary process. The DNA in plants and animals allows selective breeding to achieve desired results. Dogs are a good example of selective breeding. The DNA in all dogs has many regressive traits. A desired trait can be produced in dogs by selecting dogs with a particular trait to produce offspring with that trait.""\n\nerm hello?? Why drag poor little fossils into this when they know nothing about them\n\n""Schools should be teaching that the earth, all life on earth and the entire cosmos was created by God because it is more scientifically consistent with science and the fossil record. Intelligent design can easily be seen in every detail of nature. The theory of evolution falls short consistently in the absence of intermediate species, the sudden appearance of giant dinosaurs and basic science.""\n\nHaha the funniest one to date and most rediculous\n\n""Evolutionists claim environmental factors cause small changes in the offspring in the evolutionary chain. However, the environmental experience of the female cannot change the chromosomes within her eggs and cannot have any effect upon her offspring. Her body cannot go into the eggs contained within her ovaries at her birth to make an intelligent genetic changes. Females cannot be a part of the evolutionary theory for these reasons.""\n\nIm getting bored of this now, I think its time for me bed. Jim read that link its too funny!"

0,"Vae victis is Latin for ""Woe to the conquered"".\n\nIn 390 BC, an army of Gauls led by Brennus attacked Rome, capturing all of the city except for the Capitoline Hill, which was successfully held against them. Brennus besieged the hill and finally the Romans came out wishing to ransom their city. Brennus demanded 1000 pounds (327 kg) of gold and the Romans agreed to his terms.\n\nThe Gauls provided steelyard and weights, and the Romans brought out their gold. But the Romans noticed that the weights were counterfeited and dared to notify Brennus about the issue. Brennus took his sword, threw it over the weights and exclaimed: ""Vae victis!"", forcing the Romans to bring even more gold to fulfill their obligation.\n\nIn more recent history, Brennus' phrase was borrowed for the Legacy of Kain series of videogames, where it became the battlecry of the eponymous vampire anti-hero."
0,"It is true to say that Abraham was 58 years old when Noah died at age 950 based upon the bible.

That would be 37 years after the flood and then he died 403 years later ... that makes him 438 years old. 440 years after the flood.\n\n........ and so on.....\n\nuntil Abraham is born in 292 years after the flood ... so if Noah lived 350 years after the flood then Abraham would be 58 years when Noah died."
0,"Gravity is not a theory.  It is a force of nature, with defined laws of Physics.  Newton began with a theory, which has since proven out through continual testing and observable repeatability.\n\nNO origin theory can ever be more than a theory scientificly.  No person outside of the event witnessed the event;  since we are already here, it can't be repeated;  and since we are incapable of containing all the substance and energy of the universe in one place, we cannot build a valid test.\n\nThe best that any scientific theory can hope for is that the preeminant amount of observable effect can be interpreted to support that theory.\n\nExamples:  Theory of Relativity vs Quantum Theory.  Each theory is mutually exclusive of the other, but relativity has the advantage of being observable and testable on a much wider scale than quantum mechanics.  Principle arguements state that relativity works within the known laws of Physics, whereas quantum mechanics states that the laws no longer apply at the sub-atomic level.  The failure of quantum theory is that as far below the atomic level that we can visibly observe, quantum mechanics doesn't work.  It only 'works' at the point where the action is no longer visible, but a reaction can be interpreted to support the theory.\n\nAgain, both are viable theories, but since niether is observable, testable, and repeatable, they can NEVER be more than a theory.\n\nThe next step is what you CHOOSE to embrace, and that choice is what many of us call faith.\n\nEDIT:  They OBSERVE mutation and natural selection and INTERPRET them as evolution.  There is NO CHANGE FROM ONE SPECIES INTO ANOTHER, WHICH IS WHAT THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION MAINTAINS.  In fact, genetics has proven that DNA cannot 'evolve' between species because unlike DNA lengths and / or DNA strands with different RNA positions on the strands CANNOT COMBINE.  This PROVES geneticly that evolution of species CANNOT occur.  I wonder why they aren't teaching that in the schools?  Too new?  The evidence predates the internet."

As with so many of life's tough problems, you must put yourself completely in Jesus' hands if you wish for a completely satisfactory solution.\nThe One who made the blind see, and the lame walk, is perfectly able to heal you of your desire for sexual immorality.  I pray you will direct your efforts to Him, and only to Him, as you struggle with your particular temptations.  Give Him your will, your heart, and your fleshly desires each morning, and whenever you feel the pull of sin.  And TRUST in Him!  Remember, He often told people that it was their FAITH that made His miracles happen.  \nI can't tell you how much I admire your courage in sticking by the Lord and tackling this difficult problem instead of just giving in to it as so many others have done.  May God look upon you in perfect love and mercy, and may He richly bless you with faith, and strength, and healing.  You'll be in my prayers, friend--hang in there!"

0,"Any color which is appropriate to the ritual is acceptable in Wicca.  Often, there will also be  a black candle on the left section of an altar, as well as a white one on the right.  Left and darkness represent the Goddess, white and right represent the God, and the two of them together represent their balance in the merging of sacred energies.\n\n  Often, there are other colored  candles used to represent the Watchtowers:\nYellow represents East , Sylphs,and Air.\nRed represents South, Salamanders, and Fire.\nBlue represents West , Undhines,and Water.\nGreen represents North, Gnomes, and Earth.\n\nBy solitary witches, these are commonly placed on the border of the sacred circle to correspond with their respective directions.  The candles are generally lit when the corners are called.  Candles can be quite expensive, however, so it's not always possible to do this every time.  Also,using  that many candles is usually not  practical in covenwork.  It's easy for them to get knocked over when a large number of people stand together in a circle."

I'd try Johnny Kat kitty litter, it is known by auto mechanics as a great way to get rid of oil spills on concrete, because it has a higher absorbency capacity than concrete.  Also try Kaboom or OxyClean, which are both good at removing organic stains.

I believe God puts people in our path and tests our faith; but we, knowing his laws, determine our eternal fate.  I also believe that it is possible for the spirit to move a dying soul to turn to Christ and receive absolution.

0,"Not that pronunciation, no. You're dealing with a word that has no vowels in Hebrew so there is any number of pronunciation combinations. Perhaps the safest transliteration into English is YHWH.  But how do you pronounce that?\n\nThe correct pronunciation was lost after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple. The pronunciation ""Jehovah"" comes from a 16th century Christian scholar who applied the vowels of one Hebrew name for God to the consonants YHWH.

0,"I believe Echo was a nymph who was fond of talking and always wanted the last word. When Hera (queen of heaven and wife of Zeus) came down from Olympus one day looking for Zeus (whom she believed was amusing himself with some nymphs), Echo distracted her with incessant conversation. When Hera found out that Echo had tricked her so Zeus could make a getaway, Hera cursed Echo and caused her to lose the use of speech (which she had been so fond of) and left her only the power of echo...she could only repeat the last thing someone else had said.\n\nShe later fell in love with the beautiful youth Narcissus and tried again and again to speak with him, but as expected was only able to echo him. She grew so despondant that she hid in a cave and withered away until all that was left was her voice. That is the ""echo"" we know today.\n\nOn the other hand, Narcissus was so beautiful that he attracted many nymphs. When he had spurned yet another one, she wished that Narcissus might one day know what it unrequited love felt like. A goddess heard this prayer and decided to do something about it. Narcissus stopped at a stream to drink and saw a beautiful image reflected back at him. He tried to speak to the youth, he wouldn't reply. He tried to embrace the youth and the image disappeared, only to return later. Narcissus became enamored of the youth he saw in the stream (his own reflection) and eventually forgot to eat, drink or do anything else. He wasted away and eventually died. The nymphs were heartbroken and when they went to retrieve his body, they found only a white flower with a purple heart that we call today ""Narcissus"". \n\nBy the way, I have heard that Narcissus was either the son of the river god Cephisus and the nymph Liriope or the son of Endymion and Selene (goddess of the moon)."
0,"I believe and by looking at most of the Christians of today, there you see the answer. I believe not because i was told to but because I have experienced it myself. So who else can dispute my personal experience but me because even if I'll say that it is so, I cannot force others into believing. The Holy Spirit ha guided Christianity into the light that have shown the exact truth. The truth that each Christian may choose to follow or not. Sure there are still those who fall short of expectations and there are those who refuse to open their eyes from the truth. But what really counts is that Christianity has advanced to a certain level where peace and progress have been a part of who they really are except for a certain few who have continued to pursue their twisted concepts, aspirations and selfish goals in life and others just can't handle it. Maybe the gift has not touched them yet."

0,"They were WARNED that they MUST evacuate.  Busses were running full time to get people out, yet so many refused to leave.  Some were on the news dancing in the streets of the French Quarter as the storm approached.  After the storm, they all ran for the Superdome, and there were not enough supplies for the additional people, so that screwed the people who originally went to be sheltered there.  Something else angers me: The National Guard gets blamed for not responding, but the storm was over Tuesday, and TV cameras broadcast National Guard at the airport on Thursday.  This pretty enlisted female told the reporter that they arrived Wednesday, and were setting up relief.\n\nThen cops are out there looting Wal Mart (caught on video).  It would have been one thing if they were getting food, but, well you know the rest of the story.  \n\nPeople cry for the idiots in New Orleans (no, the ones who evacuated are NOT idiots), while Rita pretty much levelled some towns in Southwest Louisiana.  Places where there were towns were now just a bunch of cement foundations.  One person found their house a few miles away.  Nobody even talks about these people--Mississippi gets more attention."
0,"The morning after pill PREVENTS conception it does not abort anything...\nThe morning-after pill is in fact the usual contraceptive pill given in slightly higher doses and it works in the same manner as the contraceptive bill.\n\nContraceptive pills work primarily by preventing ovulation. They basically trick your body into believing that you are pregnant so that the pituitary gland never releases a hormone which causes an ovum to be released from the ovary. Overwhelming evidence suggests that is exactly how the morning-after pill works.\n\nThe morning-after pill is given within 72 hours of an unprotected sexual encounter. Taken within 24 hours, it is 90-plus percent effective; taken within the first 48 hours, it is over 80 percent effective, and, if taken within the first 72 hours, it is overall 70 percent effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nAlmost certainly by the same mechanism, pregnancy occurs within the 24 hours of releasing the egg. Sperm, however, can be available for conception for up to 72 hours after the intercourse occurs. If an egg has already been released at the time that there is sexual intercourse, pregnancy will occur and this pill probably will have no effect on that pregnancy -- certainly no deleterious effect. If the egg has yet to be released, this pill will prevent that from occurring during that 72-hour window when the sperm could cause a conception."

0,"""I am sorry but I had to answer in response to the ""believing in things you cannot see is called hallucinating"" comment. I was always taught that ""hallucinating"" was seeing things that aren't really there. Which is not necessarily brought on by mental illness. Sometimes it is something as simple as a fever, or drugs.\nNot believing in thing that you can not see. I believe in the wind... something I can not see. By this logic most people alive have a mental illness.""\n\nBefore I answer the question I want to address this post.  If hallucinating is seeing something that is not there? Than can you explain a belief in something you've never seen?  Don't give me the canned answer of "" I see God in the beautiful sky"" or ""God has helped me"" those answers are in no way proving to you that there is a God. They are just reassuring you that you have faith in God. Faith and Reality are not the same thing.  You say that sometimes you can't see the wind but you know it's there. How?   perhaps it is because it is a part of reality. You can feel it on you face. You can see it when it blows trees around. You can harness it to make energy. \n\n\nAs far as the site goes.  The point of the sight is that faith in God is pointless. They prove it by using science.  There is no way to compare science and faith. All you can do is test faith like you do science, and when you do don't make up lame reasons for why your faith failed. ie..... ""God is mysterious"" or ""you don't really believe""  there is no way to prove how much someone believes, just like there is no way to prove that god is there.\n\n\nOne more thing\n\n""You would do better to go to Christian message boards\nDon't go to unbelievers\nThis is a good site and will teach you about all the things you need to know about others that don't believe and cults and false religion""\n\nThat is the point. Christin's are so unsure of themselves that they refuse to test their God.  Don't challenge your faith, but instead surround yourself with only those that think like you. \n\nWant to find out the real truth about religion and God? \n\nThan ask someone who has thought it out rationally and logically.\n\nNot someone who will disconnect themselves from common sense in order to appease there inner need for a father/mother figure."

I was completely surprised by the number of black people I saw living in Switzerland and Germany and Italy, but Turkey was not on that list.  \n\nIncidentally, I absolutely loved the time that I spent in Turkey and I keep trying to figure out a way that I can get back-- it was a great place."
0,"I'll share with you my beliefs, but ""warning"": to most, they may be ""controversial"" or even ""blasphemous"".  I consider myself to be a highly spiritual person, but I do not believe in ""organized religion"" and churches.  In fact, I believe that the more involved one is in a particular religious sect, the further away from Our Creator they become. Why? Because I believe that our relationship to our Creator and to other people- our spiritual relationships, start from within, as an important ""question"", looking for an ""answer"".  Too many relgions (all!) seem to ""provide"" ALL the ""answers"", but, each ""answer"" to the same question is different, depending on who you ""listen to"".  Why not listen to your heart, when it comes to spiritual questions.  I believe that Our Creator lives inside of us all, and speaks to us all, through our emotions, our feelings, our spirits.  And I believe that it is this spirit within that IS part of God, as we, I do believe, ARE God's ""children"" and thus we are connected to ""Him"", 24 hours a day, seven days a week, wherever we are, and under any circumstance.  We don't need a ""church"" to worship in, just a moment of peace and quiet, to ""tap into"" (and remember!) that ""connection"" that is always there for us.  They say that it is our ""emotions"" that make us ""different"" from other animals- and when it comes to ""love"", I believe this is true. Where does ""love""  originate- but inside of us, it ""connects"" us- it ""lifts us up""- and inside us all, there lies an unlimited source- that gives us our spirituality. Don't need a church for that, or a religion to teach us this.  In fact, most religions do not accept beliefs that differ from their own, a concept that is, in my book (and God's!) ""anti-Christian"" and anti-spiritual. The path of spiritality differs for every person, and I believe that if they are ""looking"" for the ""way"" (on their own, one on One with our Creator)- they will find it, and perhaps ""faster"", WITHOUT a church's interference.\n\n                                            -TERA\n                                          (time4u420@yahoo)"

0,"Ok, upfront, I'm white.  I have a couple black lesbian friends and aquaintences, so I'm filtering what I say through those experiances.\n\nSome black lesbians only want other black lesbians.  Some only want other black lesbians but will settle for white lesbians because of a lack of black lesbians in the area.  Some don't care.  Some like white lesbians.\n\nHowever, it has been my experiance that black lesbians can be kinda insular, in that they tend to be very tight with other black lesbians, and somewhat distrustful of white people who seem pushy.  You have to remember that black lesbians have three strikes against them: 1) black 2) female 3) lesbian.  That can make them kinda irritated with white people who don't have to go through a lot of the same shit they do.  They see white people all the time, so they're not going to go running you down to be friends with a white woman.  And they're going to be somewhat sensitive to a person who only wants to be friends with them because they are weird and other-y, especially if that person is white.  I'm thinking that the phrase ""I've always wantedt o have one of you as a friend"" is not going to get you anything but gaping scorn.  It makes it sound like black gay women are objects, like ""I've always wanted one of those statues"" or ""I've always wanted one of those dogs"".  It's.... weird.\n\nDo I think that you can be friends with some black lesbian or bisexual women?  Sure.  Just don't be pushy or weird about it, and if they're not interested, respect that."

0,"Quoted from the website listed at the bottom,\n\nFor Men Only, The Art of Lying to Your Wife\n\nAll right, I admit the title to this article doesn’t sound good. I’ll even use the words ""deceptive"" or ""dishonest""; maybe ""disingenuous"" sounds better. But, if the male species is to survive we need to know the top five times a bold face lie to our woman is required if we are to stay in a long, loving relationship. How would you respond to the following scenarios? \n\nScenario #1: It’s 11:30, lights out, you’ve just finished watching Leno and you’ve given your wife a good night kiss. A few minutes pass… you’re drifting off…when you suddenly hear your Boo Bear say, ""Honey, if I ever died would you ever remarry?"" What do you do?\n\nA. Pretend to be asleep.\nB. Tell her that ""A love match like ours can never be replaced"".\nC. Tell her that after an appropriate mourning period you would naturally begin to socialize.\n\n\nScenario #2: You’re invited to your ten-year class reunion. Your woman squeezes into her old cheerleading outfit and remarks, ""My goodness! It still fits! How do I look? Do I look fat?"" Would you say:\n\nA. Maybe we need to call Jenny Craig.\nB. It’s like we’ve gone back in time. You’ve never looked so beautiful.\nC. The word ""Oink"" comes to mind.\n\n \nScenario #3: It’s your anniversary and your wife has surprised you with a candle lit dinner for two. As you cut into the Cornish game hen dust rises from the incision you’ve just made. As you take your first bite you’re reminded of the Sahara Desert. ""How do you like it? I’ve slaved over a hot stove for four hours."" What do you say?\n\nA. It’s a little dry.\nB. It’s delicious! Are you related to Julia Child?\nC. Even the contestants on ""Survivor"" would pass on this bird.\n\n\nScenario #4: Your wife’s best friend just completed her thesis towards her Ph.D. Your spouse ponders whether her own accomplishments in life are as worthy and asks, ""Honey, in the big scheme of things do I make a difference?"" Do you say:\n\nA. In this big crazy world we live in who’s to say what matters and what doesn’t?\nB. Didn’t you drop out after the 6th grade?\nC. You make a difference to me and anyone else who is lucky enough to come in contact with you.\n\n\nScenario #5: After your wife’s best friend receives her new Ph.D., her husband pops for a new rack and face-lift for her. Your wife is appalled and says, ""I can’t believe it, first she tries to prove she’s smarter than everyone else and now she’s trying to look 20 years younger. Why won’t she just grow old gracefully? Honey, do I need a face-lift?"" What do you say?\n\nA. Does the Mona Lisa need a new coat of paint? Of course not!\nB. No, I like the wrinkles. They show experience and wisdom.\nC. What I think we’re dealing with here is a tear down.\n\nThere are five areas where telling the truth may be detrimental to your health. Discussing your wife’s mortality, weight, age, accomplishments or her cooking. Tread softly. If the truth hurts and it usually does, keep your mouth shut or tell a lie. While honesty is usually the best policy, staying alive and your wife’s happiness is a bigger priority.\n\nby Fred Cuellar the Diamond Guy®"

0,"Their motto is usually 'mind over matter', the 'matter' being the ending of a person(s) life, I guess. Perhaps they have the solid mindset that the person they killed deserved to die so with this, they probably sleep better at night with that persons life snuffed out. A psychopath won't feel it perhaps. Those who are of stable minds do feel disgusted with themselves, I'm thinking.. but theres this theory where it is said that the brain automatically erases or fades away bad memories, given a lot of time. There may be a lot of psychological reasons to this but hey.. there are people who feels so disgusted with themselves that they can't bear to live with themselves and resort to suicide.

0,"Several of those before me have pretty much covered and validated your feelings toward the ""same sex"" and not much more I can add to that.\n\nPerhaps the ""better"" question that was NOT asked is ""is it normal to become aware of these feelings at this stage in your life?""  Today most gay people come out or become aware of their identity in their teens or twenties.  However it is not unusual for men in their 40s, 50s or older finally recognizing what these feelings are.  Many have suppressed these feelings that they have refused to label as ""gay"" or didn't recognize as such.  But over time as you become aware that these feelings aren't some aberration that is unique to you.  You become aware that having these feelings may be a valid part of who you are today.\n\nWe all have our own clocks telling us when its the right time to come out and recognize this part of our life.  Yours just was pushed back a bit more than some, and that is NOT unusual, that's just how you were wired.\n\nI suggest you do some reading on this, check out web sites about ""coming out"" or go to a bookstore like Borders, or Barnes and Noble and look in the Gay and Lesbian interest section.  You'll see that you aren't the first, and certainly won't be the last to have these feelings."
0,"Aha, So you have discovered one of the roots of existential angst! Existentialists believe that a perfect form for every idea exists in the universe, whether it has been put into words or not. This is a difficult argument to make because its basis is that if the idea exists, then the thing the idea represents exists, a huge leap.\n  Simply stating a disbelief in a philosophical construct does not validate the existence of the construct. One may argue for the validity or invalidity of the construct based on empirical evidence in support of one's position, however the conceptualiziton of an idea does not thereby bring it into reality. In order for your hypothesis to be valid we would have to accept that something exists because we had the idea for it to exist. To show that this is false one need only point to the Empire state building which, as an idea, did not exist in reality until bricks and mortar were set. If the idea were the reality, then every criminal act ever concieved in ones mind and not acted upon would make one guilty of the concieved act.\n   Comitting oneself to an Atheistic viewpoint is a comittment to a belief which is not possible to prove or disprove beyond redoubt, it is therefore an act of Faith in ones position. Atheists DENY the existence of a  supreme being. If on the other hand, one chooses to neither accept or reject the existence of a supreme being, one is considered an Agnostic. An Agnostic is one who neither believes nor disbelieves, they simply do not make a choice. Belief in God is a choice just as disbelief is a choice, that is the basis for free will."
0,"Have you guys ever heard of the Kinsey scale I am a 3 on that scale so I am in the middle I am attracted to both sexes and it is both a blessing and a curse. I can find pleasure in the mainstream but at the same time I am discriminated against by both sides of the fence. I am constantly being told that bisexual is just a stop on the way to gayville, and that I am undecided. Well you know what I didn't decide to be this way it is not a choice. I am the way god made me. I desire my wife and yet I also desire men. Why would I chose to be this way. Or if I was just gay why would I be able to find such joy in sex with my wife. I love her and chose her yet still desire to be with a man. That part of me is unfulfilled because I made a vow to be true to my wife. I hope that just one of you people that read this understands how it feels to be denied and questioned by both gay and straights. I am sorry didn't mean to get on a soap box but as a gay person it makes you guys angry when straights ask why you chose to be gay or says that being gay is wrong. And that god didn't make you gay.

0,"All humans have the ability to be psychic/intuitive. We all each have a sixth sense about things all around us. Each person has various degrees of this skill. It is just like any other skill that we each all have. Some of us are better writers than others, some are better artists. Right some of us are born with various gifts like music, art, writing and psychic gifts. They all are carry overs from previous lives.\n\nHow do you explain a prodigy child having the gift of playing music without education? Same concept applies to psychic gifts. If you spend your life learning a skill, it always stays with you, your Soul to your next life.\n\nHaving psychic gifts can be viewed as a superior, egoistic thing. The key here is not to get too attached to them, but use them for a greater good, service to God. All saints, sages, enlightened beings are 100% psychic, but the reason why it is not mentioned is because it is egoistic to say that you have it, so they have no ego, therefore they are not mentioned.\n\nIf you read ""An Autobiography of a Yogi"" by Paramahansa Yogananda, he talks alot about the psychic gifts of these Yogi's/Sages all over India and how some of them wasted people's time displaying psychic gifts while some truly helped people on their path to Self Realization. It's a classic book!\n\nI have seen my intuition develop greatly over the years without focusing too much on ""I want to develop my psychic gifts"". Rather I focus on ""Who Am I?"". When I really get to know who I am within, the gifts just naturally develop more and more on their own. I write about my journey and the gifts that grow on my 360 blog.\n\nOne should have a greater awareness of Who they are. That is the most important thing."

0,"Yes, it makes it stronger and you should question your faith. If you just believed what a priest or anybody else told you then you wouldn't truelly believe. By asking questions and getting answers you now full heartedly believe in your faith without any doubt.\n\nWith this in mind the first person you should talk to is your priest or somebody else strong in your faith. If you can't get your answers there then look outside your religion.\n\nThe reason for this is because if you still believe in your faith, but just have a couple questions then you seem to be in the right place. If you don't believe in your faith anymore then you are in the wrong place, but if you still believe in your faith, but can't find the answers to your questions, then maybe you can find a faith simular to your own faith that can.\n\nI hope this helps"

0,"You're right and that has been pointed out time and again. Add to that list Mithra's as well. Even the gap in the bible where there was nothing written about what Jesus did was in these other myths as well.  Most of the stories in the bible can be traced to other myths before Christianity came along such as the apple bit, traced to Pandora's box, the great flood, most other religions have something similar in it as well. The virgin birth has been told over and over again in most religions, Zeus was known to do stuff such as that and most of the great philosophers were said to have come from virgin births to give their teachings credence.  This has been done time and again, when a new religion comes into 'vogue' they take the gods and myths of the older religions and twist them around to form stories for theirs.  Many of the ancient Egyptian and Pagan gods were turned into demons in Christianity.  The god Set what the model for Satan.  For an interesting explanation for some of this see the following link, the movie on there is rather eye opening.  It's well worth a rental price.\nhttp://www.thegodmovie.com/"

0,"After learning Bible truths, it would be tragic if one regressed to false worship!  The Bible describes the sad consequences of such a course when it says:  “Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilement of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, the final conditions have become worse for them than the first ... The saying of the true proverb has happened to them:  “The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.”  2 Peter 2:20-22.\n\nTo the rest of us:\n\nWe must remain alert to anything that can endanger our spirituality.  The apostle Paul warns:  “The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons.”  1 Tim. 4:1 We live in “later periods of time.”  Those who do not keep clear of false worship can be “tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men, by means of cunning in contriving error.”  Eph. 4:13,14."

It's perfectly normal to only find fems attractive and so I wouldn't worry about this at all it's just personal preference. Don't listen to those having a go on here, it doesn't sound to me like you are preying on these girls but merely that you find them more attractive than what you see as obviously gay girls...and that's fine. Try to get out to gay pubs and clubs more and you will see that gay women come in all descriptions and not just your stereotypical ""butch"". Straight girls are often experimental with one another and from my own experience this is not a route that a gay or bi girl should follow. They may flirt with you or even snog you but they will never want a relationship with you and so if that's what you want I suggest you go and find it (with a feminine gay girl). Good luck."

There is agreement:  Matthew 18:19 ""Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.""  There is asking, and asking with the correct motives in mind:  James 4:2-3 ""2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. 3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.""  Faith is the final key.  If you truly expect to receive what you ask, chances are you will.  God is not so callous as to reject your pleas entirely.  A.)  God never piles on more than we can handle, and B.)  God's will is a mystery we may hope to someday unravel, but right now have to deal with what we DO know.

0,"Because it is not an invented religion.\n\nHinduism has evolved through centuries. It is the Sanatan Dharma(eternal path).\n\nHinduism is among the oldest of the world's faiths. It is a total way of life. It is a dharma or way of life evolved by the great sages and seers of ancient India. Its traditions extend back before recorded history. The early phase of the Vedic tradition in India is dated between 10,000 - 7,000 BCE. Yet, in spite of the fact that it first evolved more than 5,000 years ago, Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) is also very much a living tradition. And as such, Hindus are arguably the most intensely religious people on the earth. \n        \nFor thousands of years India has been a veritable laboratory of religion: everything imaginable has been tried out, and nothing ever has completely been rejected. India remains a predominantly Hindu country. Its ethos has evolved down the ages through its the ancient Hindu traditions, customs, philosophy and culture.  In spite of many attacks on Hinduism by varied invaders, in spite of rumors of decay and disarray, Hinduism has outlived all announcements of its impending demise. \n\nThe first fundamental principle of Hindu Dharma is that ""the Reality is one without a second."" This reality is beyond description by human mind. Hence it is indicated by a single world, ""Brahman"". ""Infinite, eternal, changeless existence is the All; from that All, All comes forth; to that All, all returns,"" that is what the Chandogya Upanishad (vi.2.1) tells us. \n\nWhen religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. It is not faith, but just social idolatry."

No wait, hear me out, this really does make sense, I promise!\n\nReality programs came out only after television writers threatened to go on strike because management wanted to change the procedure for paying royalties so the writers would be paid MUCH less from then on. Then, all of a sudden all of these horrible reality programs started up and sadly people began to watch just because they showed people at their very worst (Marry a Millionaire, Survivor, Big Brother, etc).\n\nReality Programming is a Supply-Side Economics method of circumventing labor costs, especially creative labor. The program does not require a script and does not require any sort of logical progression. It merely needs three cameras and a gaggle of idiots who are willing to be humiliated while dancing for peanuts on television. Even if almost no one watches, management still has a profit because there is very little overhead. The market place should weed out such poorly made products, but because EVERY network (to include A&E and HGTV!) now has its own reality programs, it is only a choice between equally awful programming.

0,"Easy: Misinformation. It's kinda long, but I was wanting to cover as much as I could.\n\nIt would seem even you are misinformed on the matter ;)\nEmo is only as deep as the music goes. Emo stands for ""Emotive Hardcore"", and is not related to many of the bands that are labeled ""emo"" by the mainstream today. If you want real emo, check up Rites of Spring, Fugazi, Get Up Kids, and early Jimmy Eat World (Pre-Bleed American). Jimmy Eat World changing style is the main reason there is a flawed view of what's emo in todays culture. AFI, FOB, Taking Back Sunday, etc. ARE NOT emo, but rather often alternative and such.\nEmo originally had nothing to do with the today's ""scene-kid"", but from the misinformation being spread wide by the media.\nThank you for letting me take a chance to spread this fact ;)\n\nNow the stereotyping on Scene-kids(for I refuse to call them emo). The name emo itself is degrading, many thinking it to mean ""emotional""(but really meant Emotive Hardcore as explained earlier). This is associated with the cutting, whining, etc. as the extremely emotional kids did this. The bands too put out this image, with images such as blood(from an inferred slit wrist) dripping onto a love letter. I have no idea where the stereotypical view of bisexuals came into the emo world, but it does raise the question why a large number of bisexuals associate themselves with the scene-kid culture, and took a sudden rise with the gaining popularity of scene-kids.\n\nMyspace is another place where the stereotypes arrived. With the new cool thing to do being the scene-kid, people tried to impress any one who would view their profile by putting up blogs of their latest cutting experience(true or not), the hair-dos, bands, and imagery. Many people see their first scene-kids on myspace, and the myspace population seems to be filled with their influence. As we all know, myspace has millions of users, and almost all of them are being flooded with these stereotypical images, enforcing the image laid on scene-kids in many.\n\nWith this being said, it would best be yourself. Associate with what cultures you wish, and do as YOU think is cool, not considered cool. If people didn't try to fit in with the scene-kid image, I can guarantee the stereotypes wouldn't be so strongly enforced.\n\nThank you for reading, and hopefully this taught you on the history, and reasons of the stereotype on the culture. If you have any questions, on this culture, or other ones such as goth, feel free to ask me. I spend much of my free time thinking about, and researching cultures and stereotypes as they interest me greatly.\nG'day."

Allah says in the Qur’ân:\n\n""Say, `We believe in ALLAH and that which has been revealed to us, and that which was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and in that which was given to Moses and Jesus and other Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them and to HIM we submit."" (Qur’ân 3-85)\n\nSix main Articles of faith in Islam\n\nTo believe in the Oneness of Allah. \nTo believe in all His Angels. \nTo believe in all His Books. \nTo believe in all His Prophets. \nTo believe in the Day of Resurrection. \nTo believe in the Decree of Allah \n\nThe Five Pillars of Islam (Declaration of the Islamic Faith)\n\nIn order to enter into the fold of Islam i.e. to be Muslim, one has to know, believe, accept totally and sincerely apply the five basic principles (Pillars) on which Islam is based: Ibn Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah - Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) said: Islam is based on the following five pillars (principles).\n\nBearing witness that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah \nObservance of Prayer \nPaying Zakat \nFasting during Ramadhan \nPilgrimage to the house of Allah. \nWhy I Believe in Islam\nThe following is an extract from the writing of Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmood Ahmad—the second successor to the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam.\n\nI have been asked to state why I believe in Islam. When I put the question to myself, the reply I received was, for the same reason for which I believe in anything else, that is to say, because it is the truth. A more detailed reply would be that in my view the central doctrine of all religions is the existence of God and man's relationship with Him, so that the religion that can succeed in establishing a true relationship between God and man must be true, and the truth of a faith is surely a sufficient reason for believing in it. \n\nIslam claims that the Creator of this universe is a living God and that He reveals Himself to His creatures in this age in the same manner in which He used to reveal Himself in the ages past. This claim can be tested in two ways. God may either manifest His signs direct for a seeker after Him, or the seeker may come to believe in God by studying the life of a person to whom God has revealed Himself. As by the Grace of God, I happen to be one of those people to whom God has on many occasion and in a supernatural way revealed Himself. I stand in need of no further reason for believing in truth of Islam than that I have experienced the truth in my own person.\n\nFor the benefit of people who have had no similar experience, however, I proceed to relate the grounds which, in addition to my personal experience, have been the cause of my believing in Islam.\n\nFirst of all, I believe in Islam for the reason that it does not compel me to accept all those matters the sum total of which is called Religion merely on authority, but furnishes convincing arguments in support of its doctrines. The existence of God and the nature of His attributes, angels, prayer and its effects, Divine decrees and their sphere, worship and its need, Divine Law and its benefits, revelation and its importance, resurrection and the life after death, heaven and hell -- with regard to every one of these, Islam has given detailed explanations and has established their truth with strong arguments to the satisfacti"

0,"The best way is to study in the Shinto Theology School in Japan where those who finished the educations become the ""kannushi"" and ""miko"" or ""onmyoji""...etc.  The second best is to interview some priests (kannushi) and/or ""divine maidens"" (miko) of Shinto shrines in Japan.\n\nThe third choice is to acquire Shintoism study texts in Japan (if you understand the language).  The worse of all is to use the internet to get incorrect image and interpretations of Shintoism from the Westerners view point.\nTechnically, Shintoism is very complex even on the surface appears simple:\n\n- Classical Shintoism\n- Imperial Shintoism (teachings that add the royalties)\n- Shugendo Shintoism (influenced by Shugendo)\n- Onmyodo Shintoism (""onmyoji"" = exorcist, master mage)\n- Others\n\nI do NOT recommend to study Shintoism online for obvious reasons.\n\n""Shinto wa, shukyo dewanai, michi desu."" -- Shintoism is not a religion, but rather, a way of life.

0,"First, it is best to understand the belief systems of Fundamentalist Christians. They believe that everything is black or white. There should always be a definitive answer for situations, in order that they know where they stand with God and with others. \n\nFundamentalist Christians also believe in righteous living. If you do everything right, you will be rewarded. If you live a bad life, you will be punished. In essence it is the results that matter. Fundamentalist Christians also are conservative in their views and way of life. they operate under the belief, ""if its' not broke don't fix it.""\n\nThese beliefs line up well with the current belief system of the Republican party. The Republican party believes what is good for business, is good for the country. If someone is down and out, it is their own fault. If you work hard enough, you will live out the American Dream.\n\nSad to say this is not true. I read a report last night that says America now is dead last of countries where someone from the bottom rung of the ladder can move up to the top. This is a striking difference from the sixties where America was at the top rung of the ladder.\n\nWith this in mind, I caution that not all fundamentalists are this way as well as Republicans. It does take courage however, to admit that there is more than one answer to difficult situations. It takes a great deal of compassion to reach out to those who are oppressed and downtrodden. It requires determination, resolve, and fortitude to observe the need for and to make those changes necessary where situations dictate the need for this to occur in the life of individuals, communities and our country."

Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.\n\n(Luke 6:22) “Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.\n\n(1 Peter 4:4) Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\n\nIt seems signficant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves ""Christian"" perform this public work:\n\n(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

0,"Great question. \n\nYour analogy to man-made devices is somewhat of a backwards take on things, as most machinery is actually made to mimic living things.  Nevertheless, machines or beings, both are designed to take some form of energy from the surrounding environment, and convert it into work.\n\nIn that regard, the brain is very much like a computer that controls the body, but it has one amazing difference that artificial intelligence can't approach (yet.)  The ability to recognize, store and relate patterns to one another.  This is how people are able to do simple things that are beyond the most powerful computers. \n\nWhile our brains do function in a (sort of) binary way, with the firing of neurons occurring or not occurring, they also are able to instantly interconnect experiences (which are just patterns of neurons that fire in a prescribed way based on the chemical triggers) to form new patterns which didn't exist beforehand.  In other words, WE LEARN. What's more amazing is that we can relate things INSTANTLY.  Think about how you can recall a memory from an hour ago, yesterday, or your childhood all in the same span of time.  You can also experience something in the present, instantly connect it to something that happened thirty years ago, and then immediately act on the combination of both the old and new information almost without thinking.  It's miraculous.\n\nThe ability to think like this no doubt stemmed from our animalistic past, and the need to survive previously inexperienced phenomenon, but over time, we've adapted it to be able to create, envision, and imagine things that don't yet exist.  This is something that has plagued computer scientists working on A.I. since the beginning.\n\nGetting back to your original question, I guess we should ask ourselves, does the brain exist to control the body, or does the body exist to transport the brain around it's environment.  Since, over time, intelligence seems to increase in complexity, one would have to say that the body exists to transport the brain around.  This leads us to ask, did intelligence occur spontaneously, or was the body designed to be programmed?  \n\nWith computers, the limitation to the capabilities of the software is ALWAYS the hardware.  Even though programmers always find clever ways of doing things with limited hardware, there is always a limit.  So far, this doesn't seem to be the case with the human brain.  There seems to be no limit to how sophisticated our thought processes can become.  We may only be able to remember and recall a certain amount of information, but being able to INNOVATE, and create previously unimagined connections between things seems to be limitless.  In a sense, we are able to continually ""re-write"" our own operating systems, based on the new things we learn.  Thank goodness too, because what a drag to think there was a limit on how much we could learn or know.\n\nFor this reason, I'd have to say that if our brains are like computers, they haven't been ""programmed"" with software in any conventional sense.  They are just too fluid and adaptable to be compared to something as limited as a computer."

0,"Absolutes dictate the universe, for truth abounds everywhere... as relativism being a dark force and absolutism being the light, the two can not exist in one area at the same time and place.

He was in absolute control of all absolutes, and even obeyed the laws he created and was subject to himself, for he could not lie, etc. He went as far to say that no man could approach God his Father and go to heaven unless they come through him. If ever an absolute existed, this does and must be personally addressed in each and everyone of our lives, for one day we shall all stand before God and give account. The laws that we teach and are taught to obey in our everyday lives are not limited to the physical, but also must be accepted in the spiritual, for we all are spiritual being in subjection to the absolutes of God. If we disagree with absolutes, we fall into relativism, don't fall my friend."

0,"this is how i see it.  and some may disagree.  actually, most disagree.  but that is their decision.\n\nchoosing a religion is nearly impossible.  if you are going to choose one, base your decision on what you personally believe to be true.  if you cannot decide, do not choose a religion.  i have opted out of choosing a religion and decided instead to focus on spirituality; that is, a connection with god that has no direct relation to any particular church, sect, or teachings.  you do not need a church and a preacher to commune with god, for we are all creations of god and therefore are all granted the same privelages.\n\ndeath is the natural and inevitable conclusion to life.  there is no evidence to prove or disprove that death itself is final; the possibility of reincarnation or the existence of an afterlife always exists.  death should not be feared, nor should it be welcomed with open arms.  it is best to not think about death until you are directly confronted with it.  and even then, you must take it with a grain of salt so to speak.\n\npeople hate each other because, well, to put it quite bluntly, people are selfish, greedy, despicable beings.  not always, and not everyone, but most of us are, at least sometimes.  and that's okay.  the people that you love and who love you in return will show this love by putting aside their own selfish motives to allow time and caring for you, and you should be expected to allow the same courtesy to them.  racism, descrimination, etc., these are the products of ignorance and insecurity.  those who judge and stereotype do so because they do not love themselves.  and people who do not love themselves often have much difficulty in convincing others to love them.  there is nothing more frustrating than caring for someone who does not care for themselves.  these bigots are to be pitied, for they will never know true happiness, and they will never understand the divine nature of the universe.  \n\nfocus on the beautiful.  happiness is an end, not a means.  do not pursue happiness; pursue love, pursue beauty, pursue passion, vigor, inspiration, imagination; pursue those aspects of life that you admire, respect, and adore, and the elusive happiness will find you.  life is to be taken seriously, but it is also to be taken lightly; and always, always with a grain of salt."

It's circular reasoning at its finest. It's also a matter of counting the hits and discarding the misses. Every coincidence simply reinforces the believer's conviction that prayer (or spell castings or whatever) works, while the unfulfilled wishes are simply brushed off with, ""Oh, it wasn't God's will.""  If I want a new job, and I set out to get it, and I actually get it, I don't attribute it to the workings of some higher power. A believer, in the same circumstances, would do so, and there is no good reason why they should.  Coincidences happen a million times a day, all over the world, to believers and unbelievers alike.

0,"There are two different ways of organizing a dictionary in Chinese.\nThe first is by radicals. A radical is a part of a character (or sometimes a whole character) that makes up the other characters. If it is just organized by this, there will be a radical index at the front that first lists (going from least amount of strokes to most) the page in the index the radical is on. Once turning to that page, it will show all the characters in the dictionary (again in ascending stroke amounts). That will have the page of the dictionary that the character is in. \nThe second way is to use the romanization (pinyin) of characters. Pinyin is the official way to spell the sounds of the characters by using the Latin based alphabetic. This will be arranged first by alphabetically, then by tone (first tone to fourth), - this means that for characters that have the same pinyin, first tone characters would be first in the listing, then for those characters that have the same pinyin and tone, by number of strokes - again, the first character will be the one with the least amount of strokes. This way of organization is very common, especially in conjunction with Chinese to other language dictionaries. However, even these dictionaries will have a radical index."

0,"""they can be good people, but what they call their morals are based off of christian principle.""\n\nI'm sorry lordavii but that's not true. And that idea is why many Christians believe that atheists don't have morals. They think that they invented good morals and behavior, and that the bible is the source of all laws and morals.\n\n The truth is, most ""morals"" were around long before Christianity. Thou shall not steal/kill/commit adultery. All laws in ancient Rome, or Greece, or Egypt, or any other ancient society. Long before Christianity. How about the law codes of Hammurabi, which are believed to be the first evidence of written laws and punishments in the world's history. That society wasn't Christian either, and it had an ""eye for an eye"" punishment system just like the bible. So if our morals are based on Christian principles, then Christian principles are based on pagan virtues."

0,"# 1 - You are not a fundamentalist.  Your points regarding the geocentric interpretation of the Bible, that it only means that the Earth is in the center of God's universe, but not the physical universe.\n\nso, a fundamentalist Christian would say, its in the Bible that the Earth is in the center of the solar system and that the telescope is the work of the devil to separate man from God\n\ntraditionally in modern times it means someone who rejects Evolution of man from ape because it differs with God making man with no intermediate steps - like evolution.\n\nThe guy on here with the kayak has quoted Genesis where it says that the world was created before the start of the six days, so this becomes a grey area also for me,\n\nso the Fundamentalist is someone who touts the line God made man in six literal 24 hour days, rejecting Genesis chapter 1. I think you have said that you believe this, but the man in the kayak will use the bible to prove you wrong, and I'm willing to believe he would win that debate.  Also, the 24 hour thing is an Egyptian design, but anyhow,\n\nThose two things are pretty much pre-requisite.\n\nScience and Religion say a baby's life starts at conception, so social policy on abortion where the Christian believes abortion is wrong is ok,\n\nbut most normal people agree that you can be on religious grounds and have a position that abortion must be legal, for the reason that the mothers life is in danger,\n\nSo the third criterium of fundamentalist Christian is the believe that all abortion must be made illegal, and the demand on government of such, \n\nThe fourth criterium is on homosexuality.  We hear from most normal Christians that God loves the sinner, but hates the sin. The normal Christian will agree that all sin is pretty much the same and God doesn't hate anyone.\nThe fundamentalist believes that God hates homosexuals.  We see people who carry signs that say God hates fags.  This qualifies them as fundamentalists.\n\nSo as a general rule, a fundamentalist Christian is someone who a) believes the Earth is the center of the physical universe, because of the Bible, b) believes God made the Earth in six literal 24 hour days (in spite of the Bible), c) believes that all abortion must be made illegal and stopped, and d) believes that God hates homosexuals.\n\nIn general if the person has one, it is assumed by ignorant non fundamentalist Christians that the person is of the believe of all four.  This is sheer stupidity and shows lack of willingness to talk to someone to understand the whole person.\n\nThis same mistake is made by fundamentalists, who assume that all Evolutionists believe the big bang occurred, or that all atheists believe in both the big bang and evolution, this is not true.  \n\nI for one do not believe the Big bang occured.\n\nI really do enjoy conversations with you and invite you to email me or Instant Message me because I truely do desire a real conversation with you out of answers,\n\ndarwin_spartacus@yahoo.com"

0,"Before the spread of Islam in the 7th century CE, the majority of Kurds practised their indigenous religions, today are referred to as Yazdanism. Yazidism and Yarsan, which may stemmed from and eventually replaced those religions are still practised among the Kurds. Most Yazidis live in Iraqi Kurdistan, in the vicinity of Mosul and Sinjar. Yazidis are also found in Syria, Armenia, Turkey, and Germany. Their holy book is ""Mishefa Reş"" (The Black Book)[73]. The Yarsan, or Ahl-e Haqq, religion is practised in western Iran, primarily around Kermanshah. There were also many Kurds who practised Zoroastrianism. [74]\n\nAlso before arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD there were large Kurdish populations practising Christianity, still found in small numbers especially in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish kingdom of Adiabene, including a large number of its Kurdish citizens, converted to Judaism during the 1st century BC.[75] Rabbi Asenath Barzani, who lived in Mosul from 1590 to 1670 was among the very first Jewish women to become a Rabbi.\n\n \nMalak Ta’us, the peacock angel of Yazidism religionIn the 7th century, Arabs conquered the Kurdish regions and converted the majority of Kurds to Islam. The majority of Kurds are Muslim, belonging to the Shafi school of Sunni Islam, distinguishing them in the region, (and to a much lesser degree, the Hanafi) Schools of Sunni Islam. There is also a significant minority of Kurds that are Shia Muslims, primarily living in the Ilam and Kermanshah provinces of Iran and Central Iraq (""Al-Fayliah"" Kurds). The Alevis are another religious minority among the Kurds, mainly found in Turkey. There are also Kurds who are Agnostics.\n\nMost Kurds have liberal tendencies toward religion, for instance Kurdish women usually do not wear hijab, do not cover their face and this differentiate them from Arab and Iranian women"

If you belong to any religious groups, or other orgazations, see if they have funding for emergencies.  \n\nDo you have close relatives that maybe can help somewhat?  Do you have any thing that can be used to secure a loan? Like a house, or any real property?  Do you have an insurance policy that can be cashed in early?  \n\nDo you vote on a regular basis?  If you do, you might try contacting your local, state, or even federal representatives.  They may be able to steer you toward organizations that can help.  \n\nEverybody belongs to an ethic group.

0,"I have been to Cuba and am not American.  Ignore any misinformation you see about Cuba from the American government.\n\nBasically, in the 1920s-1950s Cuba was used by America as a sleazy tourist resort where Americans were 1st class citizens and Cubans were treated like cr*p.  \n\nThe revolution kicked America out of Cuba (rightfully) and gave the country back to the Cubans.\n\nThrough Americas ongoing sanctions against Cuba it has become poorer throughout the decades and is a country that seems locked in the 1950s - with 50s style cars, little traffic, minimal material items and food rationing among Cubans.  \n\nSince the 90s, major European countries and Canada have been trading with Cuba and have helped to build up the Cuban economy (slightly) primarily through tourism.  \n\nThe majority of people in Cuba are poor and rely on either cash from outside their country or tourism to survive.  There are no rich people in Cuba, even the politicians lead moderate lives. \n\nThere are few jobs but people have other important aspects to their lives - music for example.  Music plays a big part  in Cuban culture and it is common to hear live music echoing through the streets.\n\nOne of the conflicts in Cuban society now is how to deal with touts becoming rich through tourism.  A dollar is worth a lot of money in Cuba, so you have Doctors working away for maybe $30/month, whereas touts can loiter in tourist areas hassling tourists and easily earn $30/day.   \n\nGenerally though, Cuba is an interesting place to visit and will change massively in the next few years once Castro dies, but if you do visit dont expect it to be ANYTHING like life you know in the US of A.\n\nOh - And yes, Cuba DOES have the Internet!!

After an initial period of confusion, a group of his most prominent companions gathered and elected Abu Bakr, the Prophet's close friend and father-in-law, as the first Caliph.\n\nSunnis initially believed that the position of Caliph should be democratically chosen, but after the first four Rightly Guided Calliphs the position turned into a hereditary dynastic rule. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, there has never been another Caliph.\n\nShi'a Islam is the second largest denomination of Islam.\n\nShi'a Muslims believe that Ali was appointed by Muhammad to be the direct successor and leader of the Muslims.

0,"I've seen different circumstances:\n1. A lot of gay ppl I truly believe they were born gay. These ppl state they had began having feelings for their same sex at a young age exactly like heteorsexuals begin to experience attractions for the opposite sex at a young age.\n2. I've known ppl who have made a conscious choice for many different reasons. I once knew a lesbian who was ganged raped and was never able to regain her faith in men again. She then went into a life-long relationship with a woman and was very happy.\n3. I've known many bisexual ppl that say it is the person they are attracted to. These ppl believe in more freedom with their sexuality and don't like to be constrained. I can't say if this is their choice or not because they are genuinely 'attracted' to the person they love regardless of the gender.\n\nAs for the 'cause', I really don't know the answer to that. \n\nI don't know why ppl tend mold the homosexual argument around whether or not it is a choice.It doesn't matter if ppl choose or not to be gay or not because, as I listed above, ppl have their reasons. And two ppl of the same sex sharing an intimate relationship does not harm anyone so I don't understand what all the fuss is about.\n\nA lot of heteorsexual society likes to compare accepting gay unions to accepting things like incest or I've even heard marrying an animal. This is the most absurd argument and these ppl miss the pt that being gay doesn't harm anyone as long as it is between two consenting adults. If those ppl believe it is a sin then THEY shouldn'd do it. I don't know where they get off dictating their definition of sin to other ppl.\n\nIrregardless, sorry I can't answer your exact question but I don't think anyone but GOD knows why he created gay ppl."

0,"It's actually from St. Paul. In his letters, Paul describes celibacy as the ideal human existance, but leaves a clause for those who are too weak to maintain a celibate lifestyle. Thus, in the early Church, many people chose to remain unmarried, even those who were not ordained ministers.\n\nOnly much later, when it became clear that if Christianity was going to survive, it needed to start making Christian BABIES, did married-and-family life take on the sacramental tone that it has today.\n\nYet the belief that sex BEFORE marriage is evil is rooted in that early belief that sex is AT BEST a forgivable evil. Today, we adopt a more holistic theology - that sex is part of the blessing of human relationships, which are most fulfilling in the covenant bond of marriage."

0,"Satan can read the scriptures too.\n\nHe is smart enough to figure out how to create substitutes for everything God does, and predicts.\nSatan is much more clever than the average person understands. He is the greatest deceiver of all time.\n\nHe even managed to get Christians to include some pagan holidays in their practices to give non believers some ammunition to use against Christians. What better way to discredit any group than to sneak in something erroneous and later use it to question the accuracy of the entire organization.\n\nChristmas season as we know it was a pagan festival even before the time of Christ. Supposedly Jesus' birth occurred  in the spring, not in December. Many years ago officials anxious to convert pagans to Christianity slowly introduced a festival that coincided with the same date as the pagan one and in time it became ""Christmas"".  That is not from God it is from humans who had good intentions but may have been a bit misguided in their understanding of Gods' will.  \n\nSo now we observe Christmas on December 25 out of tradition not out of historical accuracy. The date is now questionable but the season is sincere at least to devoted Christians. And look here again, Satan has managed to create a substitute to even the ""questionable"" day of Jesus' birth with a jolly, chubby old guy who magically flies  all over the entire earth on one night delivering toys to good little boys and girls.

It's pretty shallow.  But I think there are plenty of heterosexual people who are obsessed with the same thing.  So I don't think it's a negative comment on gay people as a whole, just on shallow people in general.\n\nRegarding the bathhouse issue.  It's not for me, and it's a little embarrassing to me, because I think that's the stereotype that people have of gay men.  But really, it isn't that negative a statement in terms of what gay people are like.  Is it that much worse than ""t-itty bars"" that heterosexuals go to?  A lot of the times, those places are really just fronts for prostitution.....the women will go as far as they possibly can to provide sexual satisfaction to their customers.....Use your imagination as to what a woman might do while performing a lap dance.....\n\nAlso, it's not as if heterosexual men wouldn't engage in the same activity if they could, but with women.\n\nAnd come to think of it, an awful lot of the men at bathhouses and sleazy venues in general are heterosexual men who are just horny and will hump anyone, closeted married men who are afraid to form any relationships with someone of the same gender, or married bisexual men who cheat on their wives using being bi as an excuse.  \n\nWhat about all of the brothels in Nevada..which are legal?  Or all of the illegal brothels the world over?  Or the red light district in Amsterdam.  The vast majority of these places cater to heterosexuals.

0,"The texts Protestants refer to as ""deuterocaninical"" are the seven sacred books that their founder, Martin Luther, tore out of the Word of God and threw away. These you can easily find in any complete Bible, available at any Catholic bookstore. Even some Protestant Bibles are now including these seven books, either between the Old and New Testaments or at the very end. But in a Catholic Bible they will be right where they always have been, in their proper order within the Old Testament. \n\nHowever, while these seven books are and always have been part of the Holy Bible (as are the three New Testament books Luther tried unsuccessfully to throw), there are a great many apocryphal writings like the Gospel of Philip, Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Mary, the Shepherd of Hermes, and many others. Most of these can be found online under ""apocrypha"" or ""apocryphal writings"". These are texts that were rejected by the Catholic Church when it compiled the Canon of Scripture at the end of the 4th Century. As for the so-called ""deuterocanonical books"", Protestants offer a number of fanciful versions as to just how and when the Catholic Church ""added"" these texts to the Bible; but the plain historical fact is that the original Canon of Scripture, defined once and for all time at the Council of Carthage in 397 AD, consisted of 73 divinely inspired books - 46 Old Testament and 27 New Testament - and not a word of the text has been changed, added, or removed since that time - except by Protestants."
0,"First off, do some research on Judaism. A great site is www.jewfaq.org. There is some very informative information there. Learn about the different sects of Judaism to see which you like the most. Secondly, contact a rabbi in your area. But don't be discouraged if he turns you away (Orthodox Rabbis mainly do this now); it is custom to turn the convert away 3 times before starting the conversion process. You will probably have to take an Intro to Judaism Class to start off with, then you will have to study for at least a year(so you can experience all of the holidays). Then, depending on what sect, if you are male you will have to be circumcised (or if you already are you will have to do a symbolic drop of blood), then be immersed in a mikvah(a ritual bath), and also go in front of of Beit Din, a group of three that you go up in front of and asks questions to affirm your faith and make sure you are ready to convert. It is a long process; I haven't done it yet but I heard it was definelty worth it.\n\nThey will definetly be accepted.  If they choose to they can have a Bar/Bat Mitzvah, you don't have to though.

What is wrong with a Muslim women wearing a veil. She is minder her own business and doing her own thing. Does her veil make her not part of the community? Or because the Muslims do not go to the bar on Friday night or eat BBQ ribs with you at the company picnic make them not part of the community? Just because they live their lives different does not mean they are not part of the community. I don't see these kinds of questions being asked of strict Christians who live their lives similar to Muslims. Sounds like a double standard to me."

In a dialect like Cantonese there is no official romanisation, so there can be many different spellings for names like 张, a common surname, some may appear as Cheng, Cheung or even Chung. The spellings are decided by a common consensus it seems. But then when we pronounce them in English the previous example could have 3 different pronunciations in English compared to its original single pronunciation in Cantonese.

0,"I see your point, but it's not 100% accurate. You see, the Bible and God are inseparable. We believe it is the inspired, infallible Word of God. Basically that even though human hands actually wrote it, they did so using the exact words God was speaking to them so that when we reread it we hear God speaking directly to us as well. So while I see your point of worshiping a book as idol worship, I disagree when referring to the Bible because it is nor ""just "" a book - it truly is the Word of God. John even refers to that in the opening of his Gospel:\n\n""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."" - John 1:1-5, 14\n\nSo as you see, John referred to Jesus as ""The Word"", which makes God 7 the Bible inseparable from each other."

0,"An agnostic does not deny the existence of God and heaven but holds that one cannot know for certain whether or not they exist. The term agnostic was fittingly coined by the 19th-century British scientist Thomas H. Huxley, who believed that only material phenomena were objects of exact knowledge. He made up the word from the prefix a–, meaning “without, not,” as in amoral, and the noun Gnostic. Gnostic is related to the Greek word gnōsis, “knowledge,” which was used by early Christian writers to mean “higher, esoteric knowledge of spiritual things”; hence, Gnostic referred to those with such knowledge. In coining the term agnostic, Huxley was considering as “Gnostics” a group of his fellow intellectuals—“ists,” as he called them—who had eagerly embraced various doctrines or theories that explained the world to their satisfaction. Because he was a “man without a rag of a label to cover himself with,” Huxley coined the term agnostic for himself, its first published use being in 1870.<"

1,yes they do (a major impact).
1,"Yes. This is a Frequently Asked Question. Following is my previous answer:\n\nThe real numbers can be defined using Cauchy sequences. Basically, the real numbers make a number line continuous by filling in all possible ""holes"". If you have a set of real numbers A, and that set is bounded above by some real number (there is a real number that is greater than every real number in A), then we define the set to be a real number that is the smallest real number greater than or equal to every real number in A. This is how one constructs the real number system, by defining every point on a line segment to be a real distance from the start of the line segment (thus all square roots, corresponding to hypotenuses of right triangles, have been incorporated into our number system). \nIn other words, every bounded (from above) subset of rational numbers corresponds to a real number. Now, rational numbers are defined as the set of all ratios of integers. Just like two ratios of integers can correspond to the same rational number (for example, 2/4 and 500/1000 are the same rational number), so can two bounded subsets of rational numbers correspond to the same real number. \nA common way of representing these sets is to use decimal notation. Decimal notation is an infinite series in powers of ten. Each partial sum of the series is taken to be an element of the set in study. A series is said to converge if the set of partial sums is bounded as described above.\nFor example, the number 0.333... is the decimal way of writing the series 0 + 3/10 + 3/(10^2) + 3/(10^3) + ... which corresponds to the set of partial sums {0, 3/10, 33/100, 333/1000, ...}. It is trivial to show that this set is bounded by 1, so this set corresponds to a real number. It can be shown by algebraic manipulation that this set actually represents the rational number 1/3.\nLet us look at the set corresponding to 0.999..., or {0, 9/10, 99/100, 999/1000, ...}. This set corresponds to a real number because each element is of the type (1 - (9/10)^n)/(1/10) = 10(1 - (9/10)^n) (it is a geometric sum; the expression can be derived after a moment's thought). Obviously, no power of any fraction less than 1 is greater than 1 since all such powers are less than the original number, so this is bounded by 1.\nWe hypothesize that 1 is the smallest number that bounds this sequence. Consider the difference 1 - L where L is the smallest number that bounds this sequence. By the field axioms (common algebra), if 1 - L = 0, then 1 = L. Now L is greater than every element of the set in question by definition. Thus, consider 1 - 10(1 - (9/10)^n) = 9^n/10^(n - 1) - 9 = 9((9/10)^(n - 1) - 1). Suppose 1 - L = d for some positive number d. Then (9/10)^N - 1 > D, or (9/10)^N > E ( = d/9 + 1 ) for some constant E (E is not a function of N, only of the fixed difference d between 1 and L) for every possible choice of N. This is absurd, as it implies that after some N, (9/10)^(N + 1) either increases or remains the same as (9/10)^N which is nonsense. Thus, our assumption that there exists a positive difference (and thus any difference) between 1 and L must have been false, so the difference must be 0. \nBy the construction of real numbers, that makes 1 = 0.999... . This is a bit more tedious than proving two rational numbers equivalent (and thus why there exist many hand-waving arguments or misunderstandings of the issue), but is conceptually the same."

1,"Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is an anionic surfactant used in cosmetics and industrial chemicals as a cleansing agent. In absorption, metabolism and excretion studies Sodium Lauryl Sulfate had a degenerative effect on the cell membranes because of its protein denaturing properties. High levels of skin penetration may occur at even low use concentration.\n\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate had an LD 50 (Lethal Dose for 50% of the animals tested) of 0.8 to 110 g/kg in rats. A formulation containing 15% caused depression, labored breathing, diarrhea and death in 4 out of 20 animals.\n\nIn acute ocular tests, 10% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate caused corneal damage to the rabbits’ eyes if not irrigated or irrigation was delayed. A Draize test of a product containing 5.1% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate caused mild irritation and products containing 21% were severely irritated with no rinse and mildly irritated when rinsed.\nAcute animal skin irritation studies of 0.5% to 10% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate cause slight to moderate irritation. Applications of 10% to 30% caused skin corrosion and severe irritation. Solutions above 20% were highly irritating and dangerous. One percent and 5% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate produced a significant number of comedones when applied to the pinna of albino rabbits.\n\nA chronic oral feeding study in rats of 0.25%, 0.5% and 1.0% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in the diet for two years produced no observable abnormalities except for moderate to severe dermal effects. In mutagenesis studies, rats fed 1.13% and 0.56% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate in the diet for 90 days produced no more chromosomal aberrations or clastogenic effects than did a normal diet.\n\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate was tested for human skin irritation in concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 10%. Open patches were less irritating than closed patches, and irritation increased directly with concentration. For prolonged contact with skin, concentration should not exceed 1%.\n\nCHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate, an anionic surfactant, is prepared by the sulfation of commercially available lauryl alcohol form coconut our, with either sulfur trioxide or chlorosulfonic acid. The product of the reaction is then neutralized with aqueous sodium hydroxide (lye). The abbreviated symbol for Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is used around the world in clinical studies as a skin irritant. SLS is the universal standard, by which a measured percentage is evaluated to promote a given level of irritation and reaction. By this SLS standard level or irritation, it is then possible to evaluate the healing or modifying characteristics of any ingredient or formula used on the SLS irritated skin.\n\nCarcinogenic nitrates can form in the manufacturing of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or by its inter reaction with other nitrogen bearing ingredients within a formulation utilizing this ingredient\nTests show permanent eye damage in young animals from skin contact in non eye areas. Studies at Georgia Medical College indicated Sodium Lauryl Sulfate kept young eyes from developing properly by possibly denaturing the proteins and not allowing for proper structural formation. This damage was permanent.\n\nOther studies have indicated that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate enters and maintains residual levels in the heart, the liver, the lungs and the brain from skin contact. This poses question of it being a serious potential health threat to its use in shampoos, cleansers, and tooth pastes.\n\nStill other research has indicated SLS may be damaging to the immune system, especially within the skin. Skin layers may separate and inflame due to its protein denaturing properties.\nA higher foaming and slightly less irritating modification of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate can he manufactured by ethoxylation of the surfactant. The modified compound becomes know as Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate. The cosmetic name is Sodium Laureth Sulfate with an abbreviated symbol of SLES."

The spines are of two kinds: 1) flattened spines that are spread over the body of the bur and 2) fine slender bristle-like spines that are situated in a ring at the base of the bur.

1,"Rh factor is a very important factor in pregancy.  Our red blood cell is covered with antigen.  For example:  if your blood type is AB, you have antigen A, and antigen B on your red blood cells but you don't make antibodies *substance that bind to antigen* against A and B because if you do, you literally destroy your Reb Blood Cell.  Rh Factor functions the same way.  Rh factor is basically protein on the cell surface.  If you have this protein on your RBC surface, you are considered as Rh+, but if you don't have this protein on your RBC surface, you are Rh-.  When Rh- blood is introduced into Rh+ blood *assuming this is the same blood type*, the  Rh- blood will see the protein on the cell surface of the Rh+ blood as foreign and will start making antibody to attack the Rh+ blood.  The result could be cell lysis etc.  Hence, it's important to know what kind of Rh factor the mother has because if the mother has Rh- and the baby is Rh+ *this could happen because the dad can be Rh+*, then when blood of the baby is transferred or crossed the placenta during laor, the mother will start develop antibody against Rh+.  The first pregnancy usually is fine, but when the woman is pregant with the second child, she definitely needs to be checked because fetus receives blood from the mother and if the monther blood contains antibody against the Rh+, red blood cell in the fetus is destroyed.  \n\nYou can read more about how to prevent unwanted antibodi production against Rh+ factor when the mother is Rh- factor in the following link.\n\nHope this helps"

1,"I will give you a couple but you need to look up the rest.\n\n2 reasons zoos use artificial insemination. 1) usually a zoo will have very closely related animals in a collection, often parent and offspring or siblings.  To reduce inbreeding they will get semen from outside sources to impregnate resident females.  2) usually a zoo environment is not conducive for romance between an animal pair.  This problem is circumvented by using artificial insemination so the female can become pregnant without having to go through the courting rituals.\n\nArtificial or in vitro fertilization is used for humans for two major reasons.  1) low sperm count on the part of the males can be compensated for by specifically introducing donated sperm to the egg.  2) Damaged or obstructed fallopian tubes can be circumvented using in vitro fertilization where the egg and sperm are joined in a petri dish and the fertilized egg is returned to the uterus.\n\nFinally risk of passing a genetic disease to offspring is a matter of simple math.  For the donor that carries a dominant trait for a given disease, there will be a certainty of passing on the condition.  For the donor that carries a recessive trait for a disease there are the odds of joining with a mate that also carries the recessive gene for the trait.  Then there are the odds of both parents passing that recessive gene to the offspring.  \nNow the rest are up to you, unless someone out there lets you off easy and answers the rest."

1,"Navel lint, or more commonly belly button lint or fluff, is an accumulation of fluffy fibers in one's navel.\n\nMany people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. The reasons for this have been the subject of idle speculation for many years but in 2001, Dr. Karl Kruszelnicki of the University of Sydney, Australia undertook a systematic survey to determine the ins and outs of belly button fluff. His primary findings were as follows:\n\n    * Navel lint consists primarily of stray fibers from one's clothing, mixed with some dead skin cells and strands of body hair. The rotting cells can create unpleasant odors.\n    * Contrary to expectations, navel lint appears to migrate upwards from underwear rather than downwards from shirts or tops. The migration process is the result of the frictional drag of body hair on underwear, which drags stray fibers up into the navel.\n    * Women experience less navel lint because of their finer and shorter body hairs. Conversely, older men experience it more because of their coarser and more numerous hairs.\n    * Navel lint's characteristic blue tint is due to the existence of blue fibers in most clothing.\n    * The existence of navel lint is entirely harmless, and requires no corrective action.\n\nDr. Kruszelnicki was awarded the Ig Nobel prize for Interdisciplinary Research in 2002.\n\nGraham Barker of Perth, Western Australia, is in the Guinness Book of Records as the record holder for collecting navel lint. He has been collecting navel lint almost every day for 20 years since January 17, 1984. He collects about 3.03 mg per day. Contrary to the research of Dr. Kruszelnicki, his lint is in a particular shade of red, even though he rarely wears red clothes."
1,"did you mean limnology???\n\n\nLimnology is a discipline that concerns the study of inland waters (both saline and fresh), specifically lakes, ponds and rivers (both natural and manmade), including their biological, physical, chemical, and hydrological aspects. The term limnology stems from Greek limne (lake) and logos (study).\n\nFrançois-Alphonse Forel (1841-1912) established the field with his studies of Lake Geneva. Limnology traditionally is closely related to hydrobiology, which is concerned with the application of the principles and methods of physics, chemistry, geology, and geography to ecological problems."
1,"Fog is a cloud in contact with the ground. It occurs when moisture from the surface of the Earth evaporates; as this evaporated moisture moves upward, it cools and condenses into the familiar phenomenon of fog. Fog differs from cloud only in that fog touches the surface of the Earth, while clouds do not. It can form in a number of ways, depending on how the cooling that caused the condensation occurred:\n\n1. Radiation fog is formed by the cooling of land after sunset by thermal (infrared) radiation in calm conditions with clear sky. The cool ground then produces condensation in the nearby air by heat conduction. \n2. Advection fog occurs when moist air passes over cool ground by advection (wind) and is cooled.\n3. Steam fog is the most localized form and is created by cold air passing over much warmer water. Water vapor quickly enters the atmosphere by evaporation and condensation occurs once the dewpoint has been reached, thus creating a wispy steam.\n4. Precipitation fog (or frontal fog) forms as precipitation falls into drier air below the cloud, the liquid droplets evaporate into water vapour. The water vapour cools and at the dewpoint it condenses and fog forms. \n5. Upslope fog forms when winds blow air up a slope (called orographic lift), adiabatical cooling it as it rises, and causing the moisture in it to condense\n6. Valley fog forms in mountain valleys, often during winter. It is the result of a temperature inversion caused by heavier cold air settling into the valley, with warmer air passing over the mountains above. It is essentially radiation fog confined by local topography."

1,"From Wikpedia\nNicodemus (Greek: Νικόδημος) was a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin, who, according to the Gospel of John, showed favor to Jesus. He appears three times in the Gospel: the first is when he visits Jesus one night to listen to his teachings (3:1-21); the second is when he states the law concerning the arrest of Jesus during the Feast of Tabernacles (7:45-51); and the last follows the Crucifixion, when he assists Joseph of Arimathea in preparing the corpse of Jesus for burial (19:39-42).\n\n \nSaint Stephen Mourned by Saints Gamaliel and Nicodemus, follower of Carlo Saraceni, c. 1615, Museum of Fine Arts, BostonThe discussion with Jesus is the source of several common expressions of contemporary Christianity, specifically, the descriptive phrase born again used to describe the experience of believing in Jesus as Saviour, and John 3:16, a commonly quoted verse used to describe God's plan of salvation.\n\nAn apocryphal work exists, called the Gospel of Nicodemus, which recounts the harrowing of Hell.\n\nThough there is no clear source of information about this Nicodemus outside the Gospel of John, the Jewish Encyclopedia and many Biblical historians have theorised that he is identical to Nicodemus ben Gurion, mentioned in the Talmud as a wealthy and popular holy man reputed to have had miraculous powers.\n\nChristian tradition asserts that Nicodemus was martyred sometime in the first century. Nicodemus is venerated as a Saint by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Roman Catholics celebrate his memorial on August 3rd. The Orthodox celebrate him either on the Sunday of the Myrhbearing Women (a variable date; the third Sunday of Pascha), or on August 2nd, the date when tradition states that his relics were found along with those of the Apostle Stephen, and Gamaliel, another member of the Sanhedrin who, according to a (now generally rejected) Christian tradition, converted to Christianity."

1,"Magnetic brakes are made up of two rows of very strong Neodymium magnets. When a metal fin (usually made of aluminum) passes between the rows of magnets, eddy currents are generated in the fin, which creates a magnetic field opposing the fin's motion. The resultant braking force is directly proportional to the speed at which the fin is moving through the brake element. \n\nSo the faster the roller coaster is moving, the more braking action occurs.  \n\nFor an automobile, purely magnetic braking probably wouldn't be a good idea, because you wouldn't be able to stop fast when moving slowly.  However magnetic braking is already in use for cars, in hybrid cars, when one puts on the brakes, the wheels turn a generator.  A generator works by moving wires through a magnetic field.  Moving the wires through a magnetic field generates electricity, the electricity generates an opposing magnetic field, which slows down the wheels while putting electricity back into the battery of the car."

1,"A Shore Line Current, or Longshore Current, is the result of wave refraction.  Water does not move in a parallel fashion normally; in fact, incoming waves actually approach at decreasing angle as their speed decreases (think of a door closing).  Water comes onshore (swash) and then receeds (backwash) into the next line of oncoming waves with a direction perpendicular to the shoreline (waves in open water always move perpendicular to the crestline -- the long axis of a wave).  As a result of this interference, water moves down current.  Simply put: Under the influence of waves in the near shore environment, water moves onshore, offshore, and PARALLEL to the shore.  Hence, the Longshore Current.  It doesn't actually move in a straight line, but follows the same basic pattern (->/|/|/|/-> for lack of a better way to illustrate this on this site)."
1,"Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes embedded in the hydrophobic areas of the inner region. It is required to control the fluidity of cell membranes. On the one hand, cholesterol breaks up close packing of the phospholipid tails and makes the membrane more fluid. On the other hand, the effect of cholesterol is to reduce leakage of water and ions through the lipid bilayer, probably by reducing the sideways motion of the lipid molecules. Thus, cholesterol regulates the fluidity of the plasma membrane, preventing it from becoming either too rigid or too fluid."

1,"Because in southern China in the Yangtse River Basin rainfall is heavy and more or less evenly distributed among the seasons, but to the north in the Huai and Yellow River Basins the annual rainfall tapers off to the minimum required for agriculture and even that is concentrated in the summer. Thus, in the north agriculture requires irrigation in the dry sea sons and flood control in the wet season. \nLong ago the trees were cut from the hillsides of China. Without trees on the slopes to hold back the runoff, water quickly washes soil into the low places and river beds. The Yellow River typically carries about 60 pounds of sediment per cubic yard whereas the Nile carries only two pounds3 After generations of peasants building dikes to keep ahead of the silt, the river beds of China are often yards above the adjoining fields. This condition makes difficult the drainage of water-logged fields and the repair of breaks in the levees . \nThe sedimentation of the river beds also makes the river channels quite unstable. The Yellow River has changed its course 26 times in recorded history and nine of these changes were major. In the twelfth century its course shifted south into the Huai River Basin and then shifted back north leaving the Huai River Basin in shambles. The Huai River deprlved at that time of its outlet to the sea flowed into the Yangtse River Basin to the south. Because of this and other factors the Huai River has been especially troublesome to China. In the past two thousand years the Huai River has caused almost one thousand floods, and since the rupture of the levees in 1938 flooding has been an annual occurrence along the Huai River\nhttp://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/huairiver.htm"

1,"It depends on where you live. I don't know specifics about Alabama.\nThe licensing requirements differ by state, but in most states, you have to have a license to embalm or conduct funerals. In fact, people without licenses are sometimes not even supposed to be present when a person is being embalmed. Sometimes there are two different licenses--one for being a funeral director and one for embalming. Sometimes one license covers both.\nYou will make more money being a funeral director and an embalmer than just one or the other.\nYou can call your state licensing board and them what the requirements are. They may have a pretty good idea of what salaries are, too. You could also ask them about mortuary science colleges in your state. The staff there would know salary figures very accurately. \nPeople who own funeral homes do make more money than people who work for them. But it can take years to build up to owning a home. I think it's good to get a lot of experience first. \nI disagree that it is not hard work. I think it is very hard. It can be draining, due to the sheer volume of work that can develop. And sometimes it will come before sleep, or family activities. But it is exceptionally rewarding and fulfilling. If you feel called to do it, then please look into it.\nI disagree that there is a lot of money in selling pre-arrangements. It can be lucrative, but it is very hard to make a lot of money doing it because it depends on how long people live after they have paid for their funerals. It's a tricky business."
1,"An international team of astronomers from France, Italy, the UK and Australia has found a previously unknown galaxy colliding with our own Milky Way. This newly-discovered galaxy takes the record for the nearest galaxy to the centre of the Milky Way. Called the Canis Major dwarf galaxy after the constellation in which it lies, it is about 25000 light years away from thesolar system and 42000 light years from the centre of the Milky Way. This i closer than the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, discovered in 1994, which is also colliding with the Milky Way. The discovery shows that the Milky Way is building up its own disk by absorbing small satellite galaxies. The research is to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society within the next few weeks.\n\nThe discovery of the Canis Major dwarf was made possible by a recent survey of the sky in infrared light (the Two-Micron All Sky Survey or ""2MASS""), which has allowed astronomers to look beyond the clouds of dust in the disk of the Milky Way. Until now, the dwarf galaxy lay undetected behind the dense disk. ""It's like putting on infrared night-vision goggles,"" says team-member Dr Rodrigo Ibata of Strasbourg Observatory. ""We are now able to study a part of the Milky Way that has been previously out of sight"".\n\nThe new dwarf galaxy was detected by its M-giant stars =AD cool, red stars that shine especially brightly in infrared light. ""We have used these rare M-giant stars as beacons to trace out the shape and location of the new galaxy because its numerous other stars are too faint for us to see,"" explains Nicolas Martin, also of Strasbourg Observatory. ""They are particularly useful stars as we can measure their distances, and so map out the three-dimensional structure of distant regions of the Milky Way disk."" In this way, the astronomers found the main dismembered corpse of the dwarf galaxy in Canis Major and long trails of stars leading back to it. It seems that streams of stars pulled out of the cannibalised Canis Major galaxy not only contribute to the outer reaches of the Milky Way's disk, but may also pass close to the Sun.\n\nAstronomers currently believe that large galaxies like the Milky Way grew to their present majestic proportions by consuming their smaller galactic neighbours. They have found that cannibalised galaxies add stars to the vast haloes around large galaxies. However, until now, they did not appreciate that even the disks of galaxies can grow in this fashion. Computer simulations show that the Milky Way has been taking stars from the Canis Major dwarf and adding them to its own disk - and will continue to do so.\n\n""On galactic scales, the Canis Major dwarf galaxy is a lightweight of about only one billion Suns,"" said Dr. Michele Bellazzini of Bologna Observatory. ""This small galaxy is unlikely to hold together much longer. It is being pushed and pulled by the colossal gravity of our Milky Way, which has been progressively stealing its stars and pulling it apart."" Some remnants of the Canis Major dwarf form a ring around the disk of the Milky Way.\n\n""The Canis Major dwarf galaxy may have added up to 1% more mass to our Galaxy,"" said Dr Geraint Lewis of the University of Sydney. ""This is also an important discovery because it highlights that the Milky Way is not in its middle age - it is still forming."" ""Past interactions of the sort we are seeing here could be responsible for some of the exquisite detail we see today in the structure of the Galaxy,"" says Dr Michael Irwin of the University of Cambridge."

1,"Rx diversity utilizes multiple antenna elements to provide gain in the receive path of a wireless system. \n\nFor example in a mobile wireless telecommunications system (cellular) RX diversity is used to provide gain and improve coverage. 2 receive paths (antennas lines etc...) are used on a cellular tower. The antennas are typically placed 10 feet apart at the same elevation on the tower (the further apart the antennas the more gain achieved, although after about 10 feet not much additional gain is achieved). Both receive the mobile signal, and the base station electronics then looks at both paths for the ""best signal"" (not exactly how it works, but in laymans terms it's close enough). This improves quality for the mobile, and typically yields @ 10db improvement in the link budget. It is effective in eliminating raleigh fading, and other signal impairments.\n\nThere is also Rx diversity used on the mobile side. \n\nTo achieve diversity, the receiver needs to have the capability of accepting multiple receive paths (two or more), and then either combining, or switching between the paths."

1,"In part this depends upon what the small balloon is made of.  The balloon rises because of the buoyancy created by the density of the helium being less than that of the air surrounding the balloon.  The density of the air is less as one goes up. \nFor a rubber or latex balloon, as the balloon goes up, it expands because the pressure in the balloon becomes greater than the pressure outside of the balloon.  Eventually the balloon will pop because of the pressure difference.  This seems to be at a height of about 10,000 meters.\nFor a heavy plastic balloon, such as one made of aluminized mylar, The height obtained is much less.  Some of these balloons will pop at heights between 1000 and 2400 meters, but many will just reach an equilibrium and float until the helium gas leaks (causing the balloon to come back down)."

1,"The beginnings of the theory of plate tectonics date to around 1920, when Alfred Wegener, the German meteorologist and geophysicist, presented the first detailed accounts of how today's continents were once a large supercontinent that slowly drifted to their present positions. Others brought forth evidence, but plate tectonics processes and continental drift did not attract wide interest until the late 1950s, when scientists found the alignment of magnetic particles in rock responded to the earth's magnetic field of that time. Plotting paleomagnetic polar changes (see paleomagnetism) showed that all continents had moved across the earth over time.\n\nSynthesized from these findings and others in geology, oceanography, and geophysics, plate tectonics theory holds that the lithosphere, the hard outer layer of the earth, is divided into about 7 major plates and perhaps as many as 12 smaller plates, c.60 mi (100 km) thick, resting upon a lower soft layer called the asthenosphere. Because the sides of a plate are either being created or destroyed, its size and shape are continually changing. Such active plate tectonics make studying global tectonic history, especially for the ocean plates, difficult for times greater than 200 million years ago. The continents, which are c.25 mi (40 km) thick, are embedded in some of the plates, and hence move as the plates move about on the earth's surface.\n\nThe mechanism moving the plates is at present unknown, but is probably related to the transfer of heat energy or convection within the earth's mantle. If true, and the convection continues, the earth will continue to cool. This will eventually halt the mantle's motion allowing the crust to stabilize, much like what has happened on other planets and satellites in the solar system, such as Mars and the moon."

1,"Shuttles bring oxygen with them, because they have to burn their fuel to propel themselves through space.  It is because they carry liquid oxygen that they are so incredibly dangerous.\n\nBut really, fire is just an oxidation/reduction reaction.  All you really need are an oxidizer, a reducer, and heat.  Oxygen gas in the air serves as the oxidizer for most fires, and carbohydrates (lignin, cellulose, oil, petroleum, coal, etc) serve as the reducer in most fires you see.  But some rockets use nitrogen dioxide as the oxidizer instead of oxygen.

1,"It depends a lot on what type of insulin you use.  If you are taking R and N, that costs about $60 for a month supply, plus $30 for syringes for about $90 a month.  If you use pens instead of syringes, those cost even more.  For Huamlog and Lantus, which aren't availible in generics, the cost is closer to $200 a month plus syringes.  It also depends on how much you take.  Many people get by with one bottle of each type of insulin a month, while some need two bottles or even three.  Insurance coverage also changes how much it costs.\n\nPumping is definitely more expensive than shots though.  Pumping costs about $10 per day, if the infusion set and reservoir are changed every three days as they should be.  And you still need to buy insulin, and have back up syringes availible in case the pump fails.  The initial cost of a pump is about $7,000."

1,"I think there is some over-generalizing going on here. \n\nThe short answer: Granite is going to be more susceptible where its crystalline grain structure can be attacked by mechanical weathering. Limestone is going to be more susceptible where its softness is a disadvantage to mechanical weathering. For many types of mechanical weathering there is going to be little difference. \n\nHave you ever been to Yosemite? Half Dome, in the famous photographs by Ansel Adams is a perfect example of exfoliation of granite in sheets. This is a mechanical weathering process related to pressure release. Granite might be more susceptible to this (I am speculating) but only because it is often being unburied from much greater depths. Jointing in limestone is often related to pressure release. \n\nTo answer this question properly you need to consider the different types of mechanical weathering. I will compare the ones I can think of.\n1. Exfoliation caused by pressure release:  From my own field observations in areas where glacial unloading has occurred I would say that this affects both granite and limestone in a similar manner. Both will break off in sheets or blocks. \n\n2. Exfoliation is caused by temperature change: I have no quantitative proof but my opinion based on observation is that limestone is less susceptible to this because it is held together by cement and internal porosity probably has some ability to absorb differential expansion. Granite on the other hand is composed of crystalline grains that have different expansion rates and are likely to split apart. \n\n3. Freeze-thaw: Limestone does have bedding planes, and often has jointing as well, that is susceptible to this.  Some limestone has open porosity that also will be subject to some freeze expansion. Probably limestone is more vulnerable to this. Granite is going to be slightly susceptible to this only to the extent that water can penetrate it or to the extent it has been jointed or weakened by exfoliation. \n\n\n4.  Abrasion: Wind erosion affects both limestone and granite. Limestone is softer so windblown sand grains are more likely to erode the limestone. \n\n5. Salt-crystal growth: This is very common in coastal settings and sometimes in desert settings where moisture in the air is likely to contain some salts. Many of these salts will expand as the moisture that carried them evaporates. Heat will also cause them to expand.  I would say that granite is again more susceptible because of its crystalline grain structure. However, there is a special situation for limestone that few people who have never been in a cave have ever observed. Limestone often contains small deposits of anhydrite within the limestone. Anhydrite is unstable under surface pressures and tends to absorb water becoming gypsum. It expands as it does this and causes the limestone to break, often in sheets, but sometimes in blocks.  In many caves this is a primary cause of ceiling collapse and it can even result in stoping (raising the ceiling of the cave upward). \n\n6. Trees, plants: I doubt that there is any difference here. Some granite might provide more nutrients from chemical weathering to plants than limestone does, and so encourage its own destruction by plant roots, but both rocks are going to be susceptible. \n\n7. Tectonic and regional jointing: Tectonic events can cause fracturing in both types of rock. Limestone might be more flexible and be less susceptible to fracturing from mild folding. Regional jointing is related to pressure release and depends more on the burial and unroofing history than the type of rock. I don’t think either one is going to be more or less susceptible in most situations. Limestone often exhibits joints that can be traced for tens of miles that are related to regional stress regimes (both shear and extensional) and I believe that granite will produce similar joints.  You might be surprised to learn that the shear strength of granite and limestone are very similar"

1,"stress and old age. \n\nHair typically turns gray as a result of aging. Pigment in the hair shaft comes from special cells at the root (base) of the hair. These cells are genetically programmed to make a certain amount of pigment (melanin) at specific ages. At some point in the aging process, these cells make less and less pigment until the hair has very little pigment. White hair has no pigment, and gray hair has some but not as much as a red, black or brown hair.\n\nNot all hairs respond in the same way or at the same time. So the graying process usually is gradual. You can't prevent graying. Some people start graying in their 30s, and some not until their 60s. Genetics likely play a strong role in graying.\n\nPeople rarely go gray overnight. If they do, it's typically due to alopecia areata. This condition causes the thicker, darker hairs to stop growing before it affects the growth of gray hairs — giving the impression of graying overnight. Alopecia areata eventually causes roundish patches of hair loss or complete loss of hair on the head or body. Its cause isn't known."

1,"From the US Department of Labor's Occupational Handbook:\n""Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. Marine biologists study salt water organisms, and limnologists study fresh water organisms. Much of the work of marine biology centers on molecular biology, the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biologists sometimes are mistakenly called oceanographers, but oceanography is the study of the physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.)\n\nBiochemists study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in metabolism, reproduction, growth, and heredity. Biochemists and molecular biologists do most of their work in biotechnology, which involves understanding the complex chemistry of life.\n\nBotanists study plants and their environment. Some study all aspects of plant life, including algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers, and flowering plants; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, and the geological record of plants.\n\nMicrobiologists investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, or fungi. Most microbiologists specialize in environmental, food, agricultural, or industrial microbiology; virology (the study of viruses); immunology (the study of mechanisms that fight infections); or bioinformatics (the process of integrating molecular biology and information science). Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance knowledge of cell reproduction and human disease.\n\nPhysiologists study life functions of plants and animals, both in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, photosynthesis, respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism.\n\nBiophysicists study the application of principles of physics, such as electrical and mechanical energy and related phenomena, to living cells and organisms.\n\nZoologists and wildlife biologists study animals and wildlife—their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential use of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group studied—ornithologists (birds), mammalogists (mammals), herpetologists (reptiles), and ichthyologists (fish).\n\nEcologists study the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water."""

1,"Hi.  I am a scientist who works in the pharmaceutical/biotech industry.  In my field, we do a wide variety of things:\n\nIn terms of cell-based drug discovery assays, we can take cells from a person, grow them in petri dishes and test new drugs that we've developed on them to see if the cells live or die in response to the drug. (Of course, this is in very VERY general terms; it's much more complicated than that).  If we want to test a variety of cell types against a variety of chemical compounds, we can use automated technology called High Throughput Screening... In HTS, very sophotisticated robots carry out 96 or 384 experiments at a time.   \n\nMolecular biologists can change cells by adding viruses or DNA plasmids and allowing the virus or plasmid to assimilate itself into the host cells's normal DNA.  This process is called transfection.  This is useful if you want to overexpress a gene or condition that you want to study or model/test a drug against.  Molecular biologists can also clone these plasmids and grow more of them for large-scale experiments.  Two other common techniques that molecular biologists use are PCR (in which we can look at an organism's  genes) and Western Blots (that allows us to look at certain proteins that are produced / expressed within cells).\n\nHistologists can take tissues and use immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect the presence of certain proteins or other characteristics of the cells.  In IHC, antibodies which targe a certain cellular protein are applied to a preserved tissue and that antibody can then be detected by fluorescence or an enzyme-based coloration process.  \n\nThese are just a few of the techniques that we use to develop new drug therapeutics.  Be aware that the process to develop one drug from start to finish takes about 15-20 years and about $1billion, which might give you an idea of exactly how complicated it can get once you get into detail on the topic."

1,"Actually NOAA has quite a handful of planes with high-quality radar, and they do use them in such projects.  I direct you to http://www.stormresearch.com/vortex/ for one such project, and http://www.ucar.edu/communications/newsreleases/2002/ihop.html for a more recent project on rain.\nI am currently related to a project looking at some high resolution Dopplar data from a hurricane a few years back while it was over the ocean.\n\nRegular WSR-88D Dopplar (the network the NWS uses) is decently effective at general alerting to possible tornadic storms... and it would be extremely expensive to send planes out all the time just for warning purposes (though there is a new test-project to setup a larger network of low cost radars to improve warnings a lot (http://www.casa.umass.edu/)).\n\nBut there are some things regular 88Ds can't give us, including:\n- better time and spatial resolution of features (we want to be near a tornado to get a more precise view of what it looks like, and WSR88Ds only update something like every 5 minutes because they scan the entire 360 degree sky)\n- the vertical wind fields.  You need at least two properly located radars to get the full 3-dimensional structure of winds... and this is crucial to understanding what's actually happening in a storm.\n\nSo, yes, portable Dopplars are very useful.  They also help us look at weather in places where we don't/can't have any fixed radars (like at sea or in mountain ranges).\nGenerally, portable radars on trucks will get us the same information, are much cheaper (and safer) to transport, you don't have to worry about removing the motion of the radar (planes are moving, trucks can be stopped), and you don't have as much trouble with beams hitting the ground... and thus most of our tornado information comes from truck-mounted radars like the famous Dopplar on Wheels (http://aaron.ou.edu/dow/dow.htm).  However, there are some reasons to use planes even in such experiments, including better upper-level resolution, the ability to reposition quicker, and the fact that trucks can only hold and power radars that are a cerain size.\n\nPlanes are indeed useful, and hopefully we'll continue to get better ones for research... as they really can provide quite a great suite of information (dropsondes (weather sensors that are dropped from airplanes) are also great because they give a rather quick profile of the atmosphere)!\n\nAwesome question!\n\nHope I helped answer things,\nGod bless,\nShane"

1,"If T is your operator, you will be looking for z where T-zI fails to be invertible. You don't specify whether you are looking at bounded operators on a Hilbert space or on a Banach space, but either way, the problem can be difficult. Usually, you try to figure out whether the operator has additional properties first: is it compact? unitary? normal? a projection? self-adjoint? positive?\n\nFor compact operators, the spectrum will consist of eigenvalues. So you may be able to solve the eigenvalue equations. Unitary operators have spectrum contained in the unit circle and that may help. Normal operators have a spectral decomposition which acts like a diagonalization. Projections have spectrum equal to {0,1}. Self-adjoint operators have real spectruma nd positive operators have positive spectrum.\n\nIf you are working in an L_2 space and the operator is multiplication with an L_infty function, it turns out the spectrum is the essential range of that function. You may also be able to use the spectral mapping theorem to transform a known operator into the one you want to know about. Finally, it is often enough to just know the spectral radius (the maximum value of an element of the spectrum), which is\nlim ||T^n||^(1/n)\n\nI hope this helps."

In the strictest sense, it is a computer system capable of integrating, storing, editing, analyzing, sharing, and displaying geographically-referenced information. In a more generic sense, GIS is a tool that allows users to create interactive queries (user created searches), analyze the spatial information, and edit data. Geographical Information Science is the science underlying the applications and systems, taught as a degree programme by several universities.\n\n \nA GIS with two different layers visible, showing two different variables.Geographic information systems technology can be used for scientific investigations, resource management, asset management, Environmental Impact Assessment development planning, cartography, and route planning.

Associated with the animal drawings are track lines and tallies thought to depict migration routes. While simplistic in comparison to modern technologies, these early records mimic the two-element structure of modern geographic information systems, an image associated with attribute information.\n\nPossibly the earliest use of the geographic method, in 1854 John Snow depicted a cholera outbreak in London using points to represent the locations of individual cases. His study of the distribution of cholera led to the source of the disease, a contaminated water pump within the heart of the outbreak.\n\n \nOriginal map by Dr. John Snow showing the clusters of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854While the basic elements of topology and theme existed previously in cartography, the John Snow map was unique, using cartographic methods to depict clusters of a geographically dependant phenomena for the first time.\n\nThe early 20th century saw the development of ""photo lithography"" where maps were separated into layers. Computer hardware development spurred by nuclear weapon research would lead to general purpose computer ""mapping"" applications by the early 1960s. The year 1967 saw the development of the world's first true operational GIS in Ottawa, Ontario by the federal Department of Energy, Mines, and Resources.

1,"I am a certified electrican btw.  A ballast in a flourescent light fixture provides the right voltage supply to the flourescent light tube.  The ballast is basically a step up - or step down transformer, which means just an increase or decrease in voltage to the lighting tube.  The ballast also controlles the voltage/power from the actual power supply from the building, beacuse this power can fluxuate up and down, and/or have a very messy sign-wave.  The volage must stay in a certin small limit range for the light to work properly.  Ballast are getting better for the quaility of light they put ie, colour, less flicker.  And they are also now more power efficent - ballast with a T8 marking on them are the newer kind, old T5's can be very hot to the touch and could also contain PCB's with are harmfull to your health.

The first magic number is 2, in which a shell has, for both protons and neutrons, one spin-up particle and one spin-down particle.  So, 2 protons and 2 neutrons make a He4 nucleus or alpha particle.  The next magic number is 8 -- 8 protons and 8 neutrons make an O16 (oxygen) nucleus.  \n\nThe first magic numbers are:\n2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126.  Nuclei with a magic number of protons or neutrons are more stable (lower relative energy) than nuclei that have one more or less than that number.  Because of this, nuclei with magic numbers of protons and/or neutrons tend to be more common end products of fusion reactions in stars."

1,"Microwaves and ocean waves share one common characteristic:\nIt is the transfer of energy through a medium.  The waves have a variable intensity.  For a microwave it is electromagnetic energy traveling at the speed of light with a frequency in the giga-hertz range.  For an ocean wave is the transfer of mechanical energy at a frequency of 1 per 30 seconds or so.  The height of the wave is proportional to the amount of energy and the depth of the water.\n\nIn the case of communications, the microwave energy is modulated to transmit information according to the modulation protocol and frequency.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nBy the way, microwave energy is used in microwave ovens because the frequency of the microwave causes the water molecules in the food to react and heat.  This is because the water molecule is a bipolar molecule with a resonanat frequency that gets matched up to the microwave and thus converts the electromagnetic energy into kinetic energy, which gets converted to heat.\n\nj"
1,"An idea would be to use a relay circuit to control the operation of the charger. The voltage out of the battery could be divided so as to latch a ""normally off"" relay to keep the charger off. The resistance of this circuit would be such that it would not excessively drain the battery. Once the relay is unlatched, the charger would come on.\n\nNow the difficult part - the voltage applied to ""charge"" the battery would have to be in excess of the ""high"" voltage in your range. A suggestion would be to use a timer to then cycle off the relay.\n\nThere are commercially available products that already perform this function, if I am not mistaken."

1,"DSP, or Digital Signal Processing, as the term suggests, is the processing of signals by digital means. A signal in this context can mean a number of different things. Historically the origins of signal processing are in electrical engineering, and a signal here means an electrical signal carried by a wire or telephone line, or perhaps by a radio wave. More generally, however, a signal is a stream of information representing anything from stock prices to data from a remote-sensing satellite. The term ""digital"" comes from ""digit"", meaning a number (you count with your fingers - your digits), so ""digital"" literally means numerical; the French word for digital is numerique. A digital signal consists of a stream of numbers, usually (but not necessarily) in binary form. The processing of a digital signal is done by performing numerical calculations.\n\nFor a great tutorial on DSP, check here:\n\nhttp://www.dsptutor.freeuk.com/\n\nand here\n\nhttp://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/signal/\n\nFor additional info and explanations, check the sources"

1,"The first step is to figure out how much Δv it takes to reach the space station's orbit (and make sure you add a decent reserve on top of it just in case the unexpected happens).  For a station in Earth orbit something higher than 9 km/s seems reasonable, less for lower inclination orbits.\n\nOnce you've got that you then need the exhaust velocity of your rocket, it would depend on what you are using but you can get some rough values from the first source.\n\nWith that the mass ratio is the exhaust velocity times the natural log (ln key on scientific calculators) of the Δv.\n\nThe mass ratio is the difference between the starting and ending mass of the rocket so the amount of fuel will be the (mass ratio minus one) times the mass of the rocket structure + payload.\n\nYou'll probably get something absurdly large (it's very hard to exceed 10 in the real world) and if so then you've got to use staging which makes it a lot more complicated.\n\nThe Soyuz FG which launches the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to the ISS has about 280 tonnes of propellant at launch over all three stages for a spacecraft lighter than 8 tonnes.  Of course the Soyuz FG uses LOX/Kerosene, more efficient propellants like LOX/H2 would need less propellant for the same payload but it isn't going to be an order of magnitude reduction."

Bluetooth likewise was intended to unify different technologies like computers and mobile phones. The Bluetooth logo merges the Nordic runes analogous to the modern Latin H and B: ᚼ and ᛒ. This is the official story; however, the actual Harald Blåtand that was referred to in naming Bluetooth was most probably the liberal interpretation given to him in The Long Ships by Frans Gunnar Bengtsson, a Swedish best-selling Viking-inspired novel.\n\nThis logo is similar to an older logo for Beauknit Textiles, a division of Beauknit Corporation.

1,"Early stars are much more active than they are later in life.  After the contraction of the protostellar cloud there is a lot of magnetic field dragged in with it.  This results in a great deal of flare activity, making nearby protostars some of the brightest x-ray sources in the sky! The period of time this takes in the life time of the star depends on its mass; larger stars burn through this part of their lives far faster, and very low mass stars (relative to the sun) still have some pretty impressive flare activity billions of years into their lives. \n\nThe second link discusses the decay rate of X-ray activity (presumably due to flares) in young lower mass stars, and talks about 10 million years as a pretty good number for solar mass stars and hints at 100millions to billions of years for the really low mass ones.  I am sure you can find more information on this elsewhere.\n\nIn the shorter term, our star DOES follow this 11 year sunspot cycle, and probably has longer cycles too that we do not understand.  \n\nThere was a period of 50-100 years called the Maunder minimum 17th or 18th century) where there were almost NO sunspots recorded/ On top of that the Earth became significantly colder, so presumably the solar flux dropped significantly too.  We don't know if that is a cyclic thing, or a random event, but i bet we find out sometime in the next few thousand years.\n\nThe causal relationship between the climate change and the lack of sunspot activity is debatable; it could have been coincidence, or, more likely in my mind, whatever caused the sun to cool down also had the effect of shutting down the solar dynamo that drives the sun's magnetic field."

It is dependent on the coefficient of friction, and on the force applied on the object.\n\nThere are 3 types of frictional forces:\n\n   1. Static friction is the friction acting on a body when the body is not in motion, but when a force is acting on it. Static friction is the same as the force being applied (because the body isn't moving). Static friction acts because the body tends to move when a force is applied on it.\n   2. Limiting friction is the friction on a body just before it starts moving. Generally, limiting friction is the highest.\n   3. Kinetic friction is the friction which acts on the body when the body is moving. Kinetic friction is usually smaller than limiting friction."

1,"British chemist, John Newlands had the idea of arranging chemical elements in order of their relative atomic masses and he arranged his elements in columns. However, Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev greatly improved on Newlands' idea and convinced other chemists to use it, so Mendeleev has been credited with the invention of the periodic table. Dmitri Mendeleev came up with his first version of the periodic table in 1864, since then more than 700 versions of the table have been proposed.\n\nNo chemistry textbook, classroom, lecture theatre or research laboratory is complete without a copy of the periodic table of the elements. Since the earliest days of chemistry, attempts have been made to arrange the known elements in ways that revealed similarities between them. However, it required the genius of Mendeleev to see that arranging elements into patterns was not enough; he realised that there was a natural plan in which each element has its allotted place, and this applies not only to the known elements but to some that were still undiscovered. Today we have the so-called long form of the table. This has emerged supreme from well over 100 designs that have been proposed since the time of Mendeleev. With the advantage of hindsight we can now see why this form of the table was bound to succeed.\n\nToday there are 111 elements recognised by IUPAC, and these are usually displayed in the form of a matrix called a periodic table. The term periodic came from the regular occurrence of certain chemical properties in the list of known elements when these are arranged in order of increasing relative mass. The common form, complete with the new group numbers (1-18) were finally agreed by the International Union of Pure Applied Chemistry, IUPAC, in 1985, after years of wrangling. In truly Parkinsonian fashion, this least important of changes has probably consumed the most effort!\n\nSince Antoine Lavoisier first defined a chemical element and drew up a table of 33 of them for his book 'Traité Elémentaire de Chimie' (Treatise on the Chemical Elements) published in 1789, there have been attempts to classify them. Lavoisier himself grouped them into four categories on the basis of their chemical properties: gases, nonmetals, metals and earths. In the first category he listed substances that we now know as oxides but which at the time had defeated all attempts at separation.\n\nThis desire to identify and classify elements continued in chemistry for another 80 years until Mendeleev stumbled upon the correct classification - the periodic table. Today the periodic table is securely based on the properties of atomic number of the nucleus and the electron energy levels which surround it. Both of these concepts postdate Mendeleev by several decades. He, however perceived them indirectly through the related properties of atomic weight and chemical valency and arrived at the periodic table in 1869.\n\nBecause atomic weight, relative atomic mass, is roughly proportional to atomic number, and because valency, which manifests itself in the chemical composition, is based on the outermost electrons of an atom, Mendeleev had chosen the two properties that in his day most nearly reflected the fundamental principles on which the table today is based. Consciously or subconsciously, he arrived at the idea that a table existed with positions that were to be occupied by the elements, rather than the other way round - that the known elements determined the arrangement of the table, as others imagined.\n\nThis being so, Mendeleev then put the 65 elements he knew into his table and at the same time pointed out the many unoccupied positions in the overall scheme. He took the further and much bolder step of predicting the properties of these missing elements. Moreover, the gap in atomic weights between cerium (140) and tantalum (182) suggested to him that a whole period of the table remained to be discovered. Later in the century many of these elements,"

1,The cold water helps to remove the heat resulting from the burn from your fingers.  Common treatment for all injuries from which swelling could occur is to apply an ice pack.\n\nSwelling is caused by an increased flow of blood and lymph to the injured area.  It is the body's response to promote healing.  Cold causes blood vessels and the lymph system to contract and thereby limit the amount of flow to the injured site.  Cold can only prevent additional swelling.  It will not substantially help to reduce swelling that has already occurred.

1,"All fragments thrown into the air by a volcanic eruption are called pyroclastics. During a more violent eruption, the force of the blast sends superhot gas and millions of pieces of lava into the air. These particles are classified as bombs, cinders, or ash, depending on their size and shape. Small pieces of lava, which solidify almost immediately, form slivers of volcanic glass.\nTogether with rocks blown from the sides of a volcano, the entire collection of ejected material becomes a hot, fast-moving cloud of rock and ash. These flows can travel at great speed down the flanks of a volcano and into surrounding areas, causing extensive destruction. In 1902 the eruption of Mount Pelée, on the island of Martinique, created this type of pyroclastic blast and destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre, killing about 30,000 people.\n\nLike lava, pyroclastic material raining down on a volcano eventually compacts into solid layers that build up the volcano’s bulk. Some eruptions actually reduce the height of a volcano, because they are so powerful that they literally blow the top of the volcano off. In 1883 the cataclysmic explosion of Krakatau in Indonesia destroyed most of the island, which had been formed by the volcano.\n\n\nKrakatau 1883\nDestroyed entire island\nPumice Rafts (lava with lots of vesicles) trapped sailors for three days\nCaused Tsunami\nHeard as far as Australia"

1,"atmosphere is created when gravity holds all the gas molecules around it, like earth's gravity is holding all the nitrogen/oxygen/water vapor/etc around it.  since the moon doesn't have as much gravity, it can't hold in the same atmosphere.  the atmosphere and humidity around a planet also absorb and hold heat.  when the sun sets on earth, the temperature doesn't change drastically, even though the sun's not providing heat anymore, because the atmosphere is hanging on to the heat it absorbed during the day.  if there is less atmosphere to absorb the heat, once the sun goes down the temperature will drop drastically.\n\nI'm not sure about the craters, but my guess is that the moon is more cratered because there's no erosion.  on a planet like earth, water and wind constantly wash across the surface and erode any irregularities like craters, so the surface is relatively smooth.  on the moon, there's no water and no wind (no atmosphere = no wind), so there's no erosion to smooth out the craters."

For instance imagine a boat sailed North for 1,000 kilometers, and then continued North for another 300 kilometers. \n\nSo it is displaced 1,300 kilometers right? True, but also the ""straight line"" displacement in three dimensions -- like ""through"" the Earth would be only be 1,299 kilometers. Because the surface of the Earth curves!

1,"Genetic Counseling has three main purposes.  The first is the testing of individuals for known genetic disorders, and then counseling these individuals about their options if they are susceptible to a given disorder, or cary a gene that can be passed down to their kids for this disorder.\n\nThe second purpose is to gather information about individuals with disorders and, with the patients permission, place that information into large databases along with scientific tests in order to help scientists understand the disease better from a genetic, and molecular, standpoint.\n\nThe last purpose is to gather information from individuals with a known disorder, but for which the causative genes are not well understood.  This includes lots of blood work, as well as gathering family information (and if possible samples from the family) to search out more information about these disorders.\n\nCounseling, as it stands now in america, can give you information about what your child may or may not have, and the chances that the child will show a given trait, but this is almost always relating to a genetic disorder.  As of yet, almsot no information is tested to look at ""hair color"" or anything else not life altering or threatening.\n\nSome disorders are able to attack using gene therapy, though almost all therapies used so far are minimally successfull at best.  \n\nTo put it simply, genetic counseling is about getting people ready for the consequences of having a child with sepcial needs, and allowing them time and opportunity to get ready for those needs.  It very rarely includes ways of ""curing"" these diseases using genetic therapies, though hopefully with the advent of stem cell research and retroviral therapies, this can change."

I'd call it false, especially if you're talking about animals in general.\n\nIn humans, though, I think the primary factor in why women are traditionally less sexually agressive is due to having more to risk.  Pregnancy impacts a woman far more than getting a woman pregnant necessarily impacts the male.  With more to lose, women would be expected to be more reticent.  This becomes built into the social framework, resulting in the traditional gender roles, now falling apart due to the increased power of women in modern society of avoiding unwanted pregnancies."

1,"1)\nThis effect is caused by the atmosphere of the earth. The reason for the orange color is due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere. When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead. By the time the moonlight reaches your eyes, the blue, green, and purple pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules. That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red.\nThe moon can have an orange color at any time of the year. Sometimes the moon appears orange even when it's directly overhead. This occurs when there's a lot of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere. The size of those particles will determine the type of color you will see. \n\n2)\nStep outside and you'll see a giant moon rising in the east. It looks like Earth's moon, round and cratered; the Man in the Moon is in his usual place. But something's wrong. This full moon is strangely inflated.

It's a real illusion. When you look at the moon, rays of moonlight converge and form an image about 0.15 mm wide in the back of your eye. High moons and low moons make the same sized spot. So why does your brain think one is bigger than the other? After all these years, scientists still aren't sure why. A similar illusion was discovered in 1913 by Mario Ponzo."

1,"Over the years, the position of the International Date Line has changed several times. Until 1845, the Philippines were on the eastern side of it (the same side as the United States). It was on the eastern side of the line because it was a Spanish colony and most Europeans arrived there via the Spanish colonies in South America. Indonesia, almost directly to the South of the Philippines, was a Dutch colony and most European arrivals came via the Cape of Good Hope. Thus Indonesia was to the west of the International Date Line. After the independence of the South American countries, most people traveling to the Philippines also came by way of the Cape of Good Hope, so it was decided to change from the east of the line to the west of the line. Alaska, originally claimed by Russia, was to the west of the International Date Line because most travelers arrived there by way of Siberia. When the United States bought Alaska in 1867 the line was moved to the west of it. The most recent change in the line was in 1995 when Kiribati moved a large segment of it to the east, so that the entire nation would be on the same side of the International Date Line. As with all other changes in the International Date Line, the change was made by a government with local interests. As a result, the line is as far East as 150°, farther east than Honolulu. This does not change where the first sunrise of the next millennium will occur, however. The honor still goes to Antarctica.\n\nKind of a trick question, Antartica is both first and last country, and yes, it is a country as well as a continent."

1,"The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10."

Hypotheses on what include the merger of two white dwarfs, or a very rapidly spinning star supported by centrifugal force. It is also possible that the analysis was in error."
1,"If time is the 4th demention, it would exist outside the construct of the human awareness.  If we believe the 'Big Bang Theory' as a viable explaination of the process of creation, then the constant expansion of the extremly hot matter would be moving away from the point of origin.  Movement can be defined as the distance traveled over a period of time.  Distance can be defined as time, such as the distance of stars to earth is defined as the time it takes for a photon to reach earth.  The earth is in constant motion.  It rotates around the axis, it orbits the sun, the sun is in motion around the milky way gallaxy then there is more evidence to say the motion of the earth has been in play a long time before man in existance.  The units of time has been defined by man.  The curent construct of 60 minutes in and hour were constructs of man.  The measurement of time has been a recent ability that man had achieved, but the passing of time  is as old as the universe itslef.  We are always trying to make sense of the world around us.  It was not until Enstien made his theory of realitivity that the concept of time to use would be different than photon that travels from a distant star.  In our frame of reference, the photon may have taken many years to reach earth.  But from the frame of reference of the photon, the trip was instantaneous because at the speed of light, time stands still.  This seems to be one of the laws of the universe that has been in existance for a much longer time than man.  Phylisophically speaking, time is a part of reality.  Our understanding of the properties of time is something that is ever changing as we gather more data under different experimental conditions that decribes the interaction of time with matter on the cosmological scale and the subatomic scale."

1,"The first answer is correct, ""Dew Point"" is the point or temperature at which fog and clouds form.  A high dew point spread is good for pilots, for there is less chance of fog.  When for example the temperature is 80 and the dew point is 45, it means that the moisture in the air will not precipitate out until the ambient air mass temperature lowers.  This is why your car is wet in the morning in damp areas, and fog is common in the morning too.  The dew point is calculated with a sling psychrometer by meterologists, who compare the temperature of a wet bulb and a dry bulb thermometer against a chart of known dew points."

1,"There are two types of motion; translational (linear) and rotational motion.\n\nFor linear motions, the momentum (product of mass and velocity) will not change unless an external force acts on it. (Newton’s law)\n\nSimilarly for rotational motion the angular momentum (moment of linear momentum; product of linear momentum and the radius of the circular path along which the body rotates) will not change unless an external torque (Moment of force)\nacts on it. \n\nTherefore, if a body rotates about an axis with certain angular speed it will be rotating for ever unless a torque acts on it.\n\nAbout centrifugal force, there is no such force acting on the body which is in rotation. Only centripetal force acts on it.\n\nCentrifugal force is the force which is acting on the body which makes the body to rotate.\n\nIf a stone is tied to one end of a rope and if we make the stone revolve round a circle, \nthe force which pulls the stone toward the center of the circle is the centripetal force and it acts on the stone.\n\nThe centrifugal force is the force which we experience in our hand; the force which is pulling our hand toward the stone and this force is not acting on the stone."
1,"Quantum Theory ----\n\n--- body of physical principles designed to account for subatomic phenomena. The theory also has found applications in other branches of physics. The theory arises from the attempt to combine the principles of quantum mechanics with those of relativity in an effort to describe processes such as high-energy collisions in which particles may be created or destroyed.\n\nThe prototype of quantum field theories is quantum electrodynamics (QED), which describes the interaction of electrically charged particles via electromagnetic fields. Here, electric and magnetic forces are regarded as arising from the emission and absorption of exchange particles or photons. These can be represented as disturbances of electromagnetic fields, much as ripples on a lake are disturbances of the water. Under suitable conditions, photons may become entirely free of charged particles; they are then detectable as light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Similarly, particles such as electrons are themselves regarded as disturbances of their own quantized fields. Numerical predictions based on QED agree with experimental data to within one part in 10,000,000 in some cases.\n\nThere is a widespread conviction among physicists that other forces in nature—the weak force responsible for radioactive beta-decay; the strong force, which binds together the constituents of atomic nuclei; and perhaps also gravitational forces—can be described by theories similar to QED. These theories are known collectively as gauge theories. Each of the forces is mediated by its own set of exchange particles, and differences between the forces are reflected in the properties of these particles. For example, electromagnetic and gravitational forces operate over long distances, and their exchange particles (the photon and the graviton) have no mass. The weak and strong forces operate only over distances shorter than the size of an atomic nucleus. They are mediated by massive particles, which can travel only short distances during the exchange process.\n\nIt is also hoped that all the forces can be encompassed in a single gauge field theory. In such a unified theory, all the forces would have a common origin and would be related by mathematical symmetries. The simplest result would be that all the forces had identical properties. A mechanism called spontaneous symmetry breaking is used to account for the observed differences.\n\nA unified theory of electromagnetic and weak forces already has considerable experimental support; it is likely that this theory can be extended to include the strong force. There also exist theories that include the gravitational force, but these are more speculative.\n\n\nNote: The answer is based on Encyclopedia Britannica DVD\n\n\nnico_guerrero1991@yahoo.com\nUSA"

1,Major advantage of a gate valve is that it decreases the amount of shock given to the system.  \n\nGate valves are open & closed at a slower speed then many others valves.  This can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.  The advantage is that the water is increased/decreased within the system slowing causing less shock on the system.  The disadvantage is the time that it takes to get the system opened/closed fully.\n\nAnother disadvantage is the gate valve could get something stuck under the gate and not be able to close all the way.\n\nHas many other various advantages and disadvantages but mostly dependant upon the application of which you are using it.

DNA's a long, long, long molecule, and during cellular division you don't want to lose any of it, break it, tangle it, or any other physical issue you can imagine. chromosomes are essentially DNA that's been thickened up by coiling it back on itself several times (think of when you twist a piece of yarn and you eventually get a phone-cord like coil, and if you keep coiling that, you get a supercoil, etc) and by wrapping it around histone proteins. this basically keeps it from getting buggered up during mitosis and meiosis, and keeps it organized when certain genes are not being transcribed; when you DO want to transcribe a gene, it's readily uncoilable."

1,"Cantor used a diagonalization argument. We show that the open interval (0,1) is uncountable.  Suppose that f:N->(0,1) is any function. We how it cannot be onto by constructing an element of (0,1) that is not in the image of f. Write the decimal expansions\n\nf(1)=.a_11 a_12 a_13 a_14 .....\nf(2)=.a_21 a_22 a_23 a_24 ....\nf(3)=.a_31 a_32 a_33 a_34 ...\nf(4)=.a_41 a_42 a_43 a_44 ...\n.........\n.........\n\nSo each a_ij is an integer between 0 and 9. There is a slight ambiguity because of the non-uniqueness of decimal expansions. For such cases, we use the expansion with infinitely many 0's, so\n.25000000...\nrather than\n.2499999.....\n\nNow construct a new real number between 0 and 1 as follows:\nLet b_1 be different from a_11 and either 3 or 7.\nLet b_2 be different from a_22 and either 3 or 7.\nLet b_3 be different from a_33 and either 3 or 7.\n.....\nand let\nx=.b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4 .....\nThen x is in (0,1). But by construction, b is not equal to f(1) (since the first decimal digits are different). It is different from f(2) since the second decimal digit is different. Continue and see that x is not f(n) for *any* natural number n. In other words, x is not in the image of the function f!\n\nSince countability requires a function which is both one-to-one and onto, and we have shown that no function from N to (0,1) can be onto, we see that (0,1) is uncountable. Since R is even larger, R is uncountable.\n\nNote: I used the choice of 3 or 7 to make sure to avoid the ambiguity of decmal expansions."

1,"Adding air to a tank doesn’t make it float better. Air has weight. ADDING air to anything will make it heavier. The tank would float best if you could take all the air out of it altogether, but you can’t do that without it collapsing. In fact if you could take all the air out of the tank without it collapsing it would float so well that it would be possible for it to float away on the air like a helium balloon. \n\nI kid you not.\n\nSo why does adding air to a tank APPEAR to make it float better? It’s not because you add air to the tank, it is because you are forcing water out of the tank. Although air has weight it weighs much less than water. When you add more air you force out more water. That makes the tank relatively lighter and it floats better."

The flocks form as feeding parties converge at dusk to go to a communal roost. The flock then does a communal flight around the roost site before descending (often into a reedbed). The obvious answer would be for protection but a massive flock attracts all the predators within the local area (sparrowhawks, merlins, peregrines etc) so it is possible that the risk actually increases (dependent on flock size). It could be for warmth in the roost as a cold night could kill many birds, something close proximity might avoid."

1,"I have suffered a lot of red-eyes and watery-eyes days during my technical training period while practicing 'Electric Arc Welding' exercises. Although our Swiss instructors adequately informed about the danger of even few seconds of 'accidental' exposure to the sparks from the welding with back up theoretical details, more than half of the students had to suffer anyway! We later saw the same thing repeating in almost all the following batch of trainees and thought that this may be the price you pay for learning this typical task (LOL). However, please read the following excerpt: \n\nAlthough UV and IR light is invisible to the human eye, it nonetheless can have dangerous effects. UV light can damage the eyes in several ways. Excessive exposure to the lowest wavelengths of UV light, also called UV-C (180-290 nm), can cause damage to the cornea as well as the lens. These wavelengths are not common in nature, since they are absorbed by the atmosphere, but are present in some industrial environments, such as electric arc welding. \n\nWelding shades: There are a number of options for welding applications, all of which require shaded lenses to match with the intensity of the electric arc current in use. Attention must be paid to the welding equipment manufacturer's recommendation for weld shade and level of protection required. Welding without the proper precautions can be hazardous, so special care must be given to the type of coverage selected, ranging from safety glasses to face shields to welding hoods and full suits. \n\nBe sure not only to choose the right equipment for a specific application, but also pay close attention to fit as well as function. The right equipment poorly fitted is a significant cause of eye injuries."
1,The answer has to be no.  The reason is simple.  What you see as red is what you are told is red.   We only see wave lengths of electromagnetic radiation.  What you perceive as color is only differences in wave length.  What ever your brain has as it's holographic chemical imprint for a certain perceived wavelength is only related to what the reference you are taught as a child.  You only perceive the differences.....  Actually color is subjective.  So is everything else for that matter...

The classic form of his experiment used a pair of uncharged parallel metal plates in a vacuum, and successfully demonstrated the force to within 15% of the value he had predicted according to his theory.\n\nSome physicists theorize that having two sets of these charged metal plates will create/connect a worm  hole between them.\n\nIf you want to take it a step further.

1,"4th dimension is easy, since it's time.  Just imagine something moving in a 3d volume and you're imagining four dimensions, x,y,z and t.\n\nYou can imagine an object moving in five dimensions or more pretty easily, too.\n\nImagine two three dimensional volumes, one is x, y, z, the other is x, y, w.   Now imagine a point moving along a line in each volume, such that if the point is folowing some equation f(x,y,z,w,t) the x,y,z volume is tracking its coordinates in x,y,z and the x,y,w is tracking its coordiates over time in x,y,w.  You need to keep them coordinated in your head, which can be tricky, but if you get good at it you can also imagine rotating one or both 3d volume about any given axis and keep tracking the point.  So, you can rotate x,y,z into x,y,w, or z,y,w, or whatever, while still imagining the motion of the point.  And, there you are, imagining five dimensions simultaneously.   You can do this for any number of dimensions, keeping track of them via rotation of basis and/or multiple 3d volumes, but it gets a little tricky, sort of like keeping two or three songs running in your head at the same time, but with practice it can be done.   I can successfully keep track of up to eight dimensions this way with ease, any more than that takes serious concentration.  It can be trickier if using non-euclidian volumes, but in some cases, like the small curled dimensions used in string theory, it can actually be easier than dealing with many large dimensions."

1,"It is Louis Pasteur. In France in the late 1870s, anthrax was a severe disease that destroyed flocks of sheep. This  influenced Louis Pasteur to direct his attention to the study of anthrax. He had just developed a regimen for heat attenuation of the causative agent of chicken cholera, and he used a similar approach in his studies of virulent anthrax bacilli. Cultures of the organism grown at elevated temperatures were shown to be decreased in virulence.\nIn historic field trials at Pouilly-le-Fort in 1881, Pasteur showed that these heat-attenuated organisms were capable of producing immunity against later challenge with virulent strains of the bacillus in animals. Pasteur is therefore given credit for developing the first vaccine effective in the prevention of anthrax."

1,"Milliways?\n\nAnyhoo...\n\nExcuse the geek humor.  It depends on what you mean by the end of space.  If you mean the destruction of the universe, there's a lot of theories out there.  If you mean the physical edges of the universe, there is nothing, no vacuum.  The universe is all that exists, there is nothing outside it.  It's a difficult concept to visualize sometimes.\n\nSome end-of-the-universe theories include the big crunch where the outward movement of the universe reverses itself and returns to a common origin; the opposite of the big bang.  Opposite of the big crunch is the quiet freeze, where the universe keeps expanding, planets drift so far away from each other, entropy takes control, all energy is slowly expended and the universe drifts into a quiet soft end.  Those two theories depend on the cosmological constant.\n\nThere's also a theory where many of our cosmological constants which define the laws of physics and allow for the universe to exist could change and matter simply crumbles at its most basic level (even quarks, which are base atom components, would fall apart).  Another somewhat worrying theory is that physicist working in supercolliders could set off a quantum vacuum collapses, this off course assumes that the quantum vacuum is not at is lowest stable state which is unlikely.\n\nOne of my favorite theories is the result of M-theory, otherwise known as Brane theory.  Brane theory suggests that the laws our universe is governed by a ""membrane"" created from supersmall (Planck length, 10^-35 meters) one-dimensional strings.  It's easiest to think of the piano, music is created but is not tangible, it is created from vibration of strings.  The way this membrane is folded creates the laws and constants that govern our universe.  There could be, literally millions of membranes and millions of universes.  The theory goes onto suggest that our universe was created from the collision of two membranes; and so too could it end that way.\n\nThere's a lot of different theories, if you're interested in end-of-the-world/end-of-the-universe theories I'd recommend you visit Exit Mundi, linked below."

Weight is simply the mass of an object multiplied by the acceleration of gravity (32.2 feet per second).\n\nMolecules in fluids can move around very easily.  They are constantly being pulled downward by gravity.  Generally, they are blocked by other fluid molecules already below them but they pile up and apply a pressure to the poor suckers below them.  The molecules at the bottom of the stack are under tremendous pressure in very deep portions of the ocean because they have to support the weight of the molecules above them.  (This also creates a sea level air pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch)\n\nShips weigh less than the water they displace.  Gravity is pulling that ship down, trying to get it to the center of the Earth.  Once the weight of the water equals the weight of the ship, the water pushes back with enough force to keep it afloat.  Water molecules can flow easily.  When they begin to weigh more than the effective weight of the ship, they will flow beneath it and push the ship upward."

1,"Bermuda Triangle\nBermuda Triangle, region of the western Atlantic Ocean that has become associated in the popular imagination with mysterious maritime disasters. Also known as the Devil's Triangle, the triangle-shaped area covers about 1,140,000 sq km (about 440,000 sq mi) between the island of Bermuda, the coast of southern Florida, and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe sinister reputation of the Bermuda Triangle may be traceable to reports made in the late 15th century by navigator Christopher Columbus concerning the Sargasso Sea, in which floating masses of gulfweed were regarded as uncanny and perilous by early sailors; others date the notoriety of the area to the mid-19th century, when a number of reports were made of unexplained disappearances and mysteriously abandoned ships. The earliest recorded disappearance of a United States vessel in the area occurred in March 1918, when the USS Cyclops vanished.\n\nThe incident that consolidated the reputation of the Bermuda Triangle was the disappearance in December 1945 of Flight 19, a training squadron of five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers. The squadron left Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with 14 crewmen and disappeared after radioing a series of distress messages; a seaplane sent in search of the squadron also disappeared. Aircraft that have disappeared in the area since this incident include a DC-3 carrying 27 passengers in 1948 and a C-124 Globemaster with 53 passengers in 1951. Among the ships that have disappeared was the tankership Marine Sulphur Queen, which vanished with 39 men aboard in 1963.\n\nBooks, articles, and television broadcasts investigating the Bermuda Triangle emphasize that, in the case of most of the disappearances, the weather was favorable, the disappearances occurred in daylight after a sudden break in radio contact, and the vessels vanished without a trace. However, skeptics point out that many supposed mysteries result from careless or biased consideration of data. For example, some losses attributed to the Bermuda Triangle actually occurred outside the area of the triangle in inclement weather conditions or in darkness, and some can be traced to known mechanical problems or inadequate equipment. In the case of Flight 19, for example, the squadron commander was relatively inexperienced, a compass was faulty, the squadron failed to follow instructions, and the aircraft were operating under conditions of deteriorating weather and visibility and with a low fuel supply. Other proposed explanations for disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle include the action of physical forces unknown to science, a “hole in the sky,” an unusual chemical component in the region's seawater, and abduction by extraterrestrial beings.\n\nScientific evaluations of the Bermuda Triangle have concluded that the number of disappearances in the region is not abnormal and that most of the disappearances have logical explanations. Paranormal associations with the Bermuda Triangle persist in the public mind, however."

1,"In physics, a virtual particle is a particle-like abstraction used in some models of quantum field theory. Virtual particles exhibit some of the phenomena that real particles do such as conservation of charge. Nevertheless they are unobservable by their very definition, and furthermore do not respect some of the most fundamental laws associated with physical particles. The concept of virtual particles necessarily arises in the perturbation theory of quantum field theory where interactions between real particles are described in terms of exchanges of virtual particles. Any process involving virtual particles admits a schematic representation known as a Feynman diagram which facilitates understanding of calculations.\n\nThe term is rather loose and vaguely defined, in the sense that it clings to a rather incorrect view that the world is somehow made up of ""real particles"": it is not; rather, ""real particles"" are more accurately understood to be excitations of the underlying quantum fields. As such, virtual particles are also excitations of the underlying fields, but are ""temporary"" in the sense that they appear in calculations, but never as indexes to the scattering matrix. In this sense, virtual particles are an artifact of perturbation theory, and do not appear in a nonperturbative treatment. As such, their existence is questionable; however, the term is useful in informal, casual conversation, or in rendering concepts into layman's terms.\n\nThere are two principal ways in which the notion of virtual particles appear in modern physics. They appear as intermediate terms in Feynman diagrams; that is, as terms in a perturbative calculation. They also appear as an infinite set of states to be summed or integrated over in the calculation of a semi-non-perturbative effect. In the later case, it is sometimes said that virtual particles cause the effect, or that the effect occurs because of the existence of virtual particles.\n\nIn the latter class, there are six well-known effects in particle physics that are often ascribed to virtual particles (specifically to virtual photons in all but the last case):\n\nThe spontaneous emission of a photon during the decay of an excited atom or nucleus; such a decay is prohibited by ordinary quantum mechanics and requires the quantization of the electromagnetic field for its explanation, \nThe Casimir effect, where the the ground state of the quantized electromagnetic field causes a weak, short-range attraction between a pair of electically neutral metal plates, \nThe van der Waals force, which is essentially the Casimir effect between two atoms, \nVacuum polarization, which involves pair production or the decay of the vacuum, which is the spontaneous production of particle-antiparticle pairs (such as electron-positron), \nHawking radiation, where the gravitational field is so strong that it causes the spontaneous production of particle pairs. \nMost of these have analogous effects in solid-state physics; indeed, one can often gain a better intuitive understanding by examining these cases. In semiconductors, the roles of electrons, positrons and photons in field theory are replaced by electrons in the conduction band, holes in the valence band, and phonons or vibrations of the crystal lattice.\n\nAntiparticles have been proven to exist and should not be confused with virtual particles or virtual antiparticles."
1,"(m)\n\nSeventy to seventy-five percent of what we perceive as taste actually comes from our sense of smell. Taste buds allow us to perceive only bitter, salty, sweet, and sour flavors. It's the odor molecules from food that give us most of our taste sensation. \n\nWhen you put food in your mouth, odor molecules from that food travel through the passage between your nose and mouth to olfactory receptor cells at the top of your nasal cavity, just beneath the brain and behind the bridge of the nose. If mucus in your nasal passages becomes too thick, air and odor molecules can't reach your olfactory receptor cells. Thus, your brain receives no signal identifying the odor, and everything you eat tastes much the same. You can feel the texture and temperature of the food, but no messengers can tell your brain, ""This cool, milky substance is chocolate ice cream."" The odor molecules remain trapped in your mouth. The pathway has been blocked off to those powerful perceivers of smell--the olfactory bulbs. \n\nOf all our senses, smell is our most primal. Animals need the sense of smell to survive. Although a blind rat might survive, a rat without its sense of smell can't mate or find food. For humans, the sense of smell communicates many of the pleasures in life--the aroma of a pot roast in the oven, fresh-cut hay, a rose garden. Smells can also signal danger, fear, or dread. \n\nAlthough our sense of smell is our most primal, it is also very complex. To identify the smell of a rose, the brain analyzes over 300 odor molecules. The average person can discriminate between 4,000 to 10,000 different odor molecules. Much is unknown about exactly how we detect and discriminate between various odors. But researchers have discovered that an odor can only be detected in liquid form. We breathe in airborne molecules that travel to and combine with receptors in nasal cells. The cilia, hairlike receptors that extend from cells inside the nose, are covered with a thin, clear mucus that dissolves odor molecules not already in vapor form. When the mucus becomes too thick, it can no longer dissolve the molecules. \n\nAnimals depend on odors secreted from their bodies to communicate. For humans, odors communicate a variety of messages, depending on the odor and the person receiving it. The aroma of a baking apple pie sends one message when someone is hungry and quite another when that person has just finished a six-course meal!"

1,"A third world country these days usually refers to a developing country. IOW third world means a poor country with a low standard of living, limited healthcare, limited education and so forth.\n\nThere used to be second world countries, but not any more.\n\nAfter the second world war the world was described as being divided in two. The first world consisted of the westernised capitalist nations headed by the US and England but including Japan, Australia, Canada and so forth. The second world was the communist bloc headed by the USSR and China but including Poland, Cuba, Vietnam, Poland and so forth.\n\nThe term ""Third World"" was coined to describe all those nations that were not strongly aligned with either camp. Initially this referred to nations such as India and Egypt or Chile that were quite happy to do business with Russia or America based entirely on who gave them the most aid. Eventually the term expanded to refer to all the poor nations.\n\nSo basically ""First World"" = westernised capitalist nations, ""Second World"" = communist nations, ""Third World"" = poor nations not aligned with either first or second world powers.\n\nThese days there aren't really any second world nations. China is the only communist power left, and it is becoming so capitalistic so fast that it hardly deserves the title communist. The remaining handful of communist nations such as Cuba and North Korea are so weak that they don't warrant the term 'second world'. Today we really only refer to first and third world, with Cuba for example considered to be squarely third world.\n\n\nMore commonly we simply refer to developed and developing world."

1,"Physics (from the Greek, φύσις (phúsis), ""nature"" and φυσική (phusiké), ""knowledge of nature"") is the science concerned with the discovery and understanding of the fundamental laws which govern matter, energy, space and time. That is, physics deals with the elementary constituents of the Universe and their interactions, as well as the analysis of systems which are best understood in terms of these fundamental principles. Physics is a study of the inorganic, physical world, as opposed to the organic world of biology, physiology, etc. [1] Physics overlaps with chemistry concerning the electro-chemical interactions of substances.\nCentral theories\n\nWhile physics deals with a wide variety of systems, there are certain theories that are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed of light. These theories continue to be areas of active research; for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as chaos was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by Isaac Newton (1642–1727). These ""central theories"" are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them.\n\n    * Classical mechanics is a model of the physics of forces acting upon bodies. It is often referred to as ""Newtonian mechanics"" after Newton and his laws of motion. Classical mechanics is subdivided into statics (which models objects at rest), kinematics (which models objects in motion), and dynamics (which models objects subjected to forces). See also mechanics.\n\n    * Electromagnetism, or electromagnetic theory, is the physics of the electromagnetic field: a field, encompassing all of space, which exerts a force on those particles that possess the property of electric charge, and is in turn affected by the presence and motion of such particles. Electromagnetism encompasses various real-world electromagnetic phenomena.\n\n    * Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the action of heat and the conversions from one to another of various forms of energy. Thermodynamics is particularly concerned with how these affect temperature, pressure, volume, mechanical action, and work. Historically, it grew out of efforts to construct more efficient heat engines — devices for extracting useful work from expanding hot gases.\n\n    * Statistical mechanics, a related theory, is the branch of physics that analyzes macroscopic systems by applying statistical principles to their microscopic constituents and, thus, can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of bulk materials from the spectroscopic data of individual molecules.\n\n    * Quantum mechanics is the branch of mathematical physics treating atomic and subatomic systems and their interaction with radiation in terms of observable quantities. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called quanta. Quantum theory typically permits only probable or statistical calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of wave functions.\n\n    * The theory of relativity, or relativity theory, is:\n\n    *\n          o A physical theory which is based on two postulates (1) that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and independent of the source or observer and (2) that it is impossible to determine ones absolute velocity in any inertial systems and which leads to the deduction of the equivalence of mass and energy and of change in mass, dimension, and time with increased velocity — called also spec"

1,"Klinefelter's syndrome, 47XXY or XXY syndrome is a condition caused by a chromosome nondisjunction in males; affected individuals have a pair of X sex chromosomes instead of just one, and are associated with additional risk for some medical conditions. It is named after Dr. Harry Klinefelter, a medical researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, who first described this condition in 1942.[1]\n\nXXY males are almost always sterile, and some degree of language impairment may be present. In adults, possible characteristics vary widely and include little to no signs of affectedness, a lanky, youthful build and facial appearance, or a rounded body type with some degree of gynecomastia (increased breast tissue). Gynecomastia to some extent is present in about a third of individuals affected, a higher percentage than in the XY population. The far end of the spectrum is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, pulmonary disease, varicose veins, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis, risks shared with women.\n\nRare X-linked recessive problems occur even more infrequently in XXY males, since these conditions are transmitted by genes on the X chromosome, and people with two X chromosomes are typically carriers rather than affected.\n\nThere are many variances within the XXY population, just like in the 46,XY population. While it is possible to characterise 47,XXY males with certain body types, that in itself should not be the method of identification as to whether someone has 47,XXY or not.

1,"100 years ago cocaine was legal. It was not until the pure food and drug act of 1906 that made cocaine and many other drugs illegal. The pure food and drug act of 1906 was signed into law by then President Teddy Roosevelt who one morning was eating a plate of sausage while reading the controversial book by Upton Sinclair The Jungle (About the practices of the meat processing industry, which at the time had human fingers and dead mice as part of the meat products going into the market). However, the ban on cocaine in the pure food and drug act of 1906 was only amplified in 1970 by the signing of the controlled substance act. Viagra though was a different story, in 1989 Pfizer was testing a cancer drug that had a side effect of treating erectile dysfunction, and then 9 years later was remarketed as Viagra. And finally to answer the main point of your question, it is not the drug dealers fighting among each other that are the problem with the drugs. It's the crooked bankers who launder their drug money, and what you do is take George Carlin's advice and you take about 10 of these bankers every Monday Night and you nail them to crosses during the halftime show of Monday Night Football, and then you get Marlboro Cigarettes and Dow Chemicals to sponsor the whole thing, and then you talk about that drug trade really slowing down. So it's not really a matter of legalizing drugs, just more a matter of taking away the source of money laundering that these drug dealers use."

1,"Non linear science study phenomena which are non linear in nature, such as the well known butterfly effect. What does it mean for a phenomenon to be linear? It means that the outcome of the experiment changes linearly with the input : for example if a car weighs twice as much as another, it takes twice more energy to move it. This property makes it easier to study and predict the outcome of experiments. Linear approximations are used in many fields of physics (and other sciences too)\n\nUnfortunately, some phenomena do not have this behavior. The butterfly effect is one of the most extreme illustrations of that: while a tornado will not be caused by a butterfly alone, the butterfly could make it appear 15 miles from where it would have without it.\n\nNon linear science is the perfectly valid science that studies this kind of problems."

1,"Ionization potential is defined as the energy require to turn a neutral atom into an ion. Usually, this refers to the first ionization energy, i.e., the energy to remove the 1st electron in an atom. Using the same idea, the 2nd ionization energy, for example, refers to the energy that is required to remove the 2nd electon after the removal of the first electron.\n\nIn this case, you are likely to refer to the first ionization potential of group 1 metal, so let's just focus on this. Group 1 metals (Li, Na, etc.) all have 1 valence electron. To turn to the most stable form, these metals have to lose that only one electron to form a 1+ ion, which has the same electron configuration as a noble gas. As you go down the periodic table, more electron shells are added to the elements, i.e., the atomic radius increases. As you may know, the negative electrons are attracted to the positive protons in the core. As the size of the atom gets bigger, it is harder for the core to experience the outermost electron (this is due to shielding effect by the inner shells), and thus the attraction between the inner core and the outermost electrons are weaker for bigger elements. As a result, it is easier to lose the valence electrons for the bigger elements than the smaller elements (provided that they all have the same valence electrons). Therefore, you should expect K to be more reactive than Li, for example."

1,"FSI is ""A measure of the tendency of a coal to swell when heated under controlled conditions."" \n\nIts interaction with boiler operations is summarized here:\nCoking coal is best if it has a very narrow range of volatility and plasticity. This is measured by the Free Swelling Index test. Tar content, volatile content and swelling index are used to select coals for coke blending.\n\nVolatility is also critical for steel making and power generation, as this determines the burn rate of the coal. High volatile content coals, while easy to ignite often are not as prized as moderately volatile coals; low volatile coal may be difficult to ignite although it will contain more energy per unit volume. The smelter must balance the volatile content of the coals to optimise the ease of ignition, burn rate, and energy output of the coal.\n\nLow ash, sulphur, and carbonate coals are prized for power generation because they do not produce much boiler slag and they do not require as much effort to scrub the flue gases to remove particulate matter. Carbonates are deleterious as they readily stick to the boiler apparatus. Sulphide contents are also deleterious in some fashion as this sulphur is emitted and can form smog, acid rain and haze pollution. Again, scrubbers on the flue gases aim to eliminate particulate and sulphur emissions."

1,"OK.  Instances of evolution (speciation, not just adaptation to pesticides or antibiotics through selection):\n\nEvening Primrose (Oenothera gigas)\n\nWhile studying the genetics of the evening primrose, Oenothera lamarckiana, de Vries (1905) found an unusual variant among his plants. O. lamarckiana has a chromosome number of 2N = 14. The variant had a chromosome number of 2N = 28. He found that he was unable to breed this variant with O. lamarckiana. He named this new species O. gigas.\n\nRaphanobrassica\n\nThe Russian cytologist Karpchenko (1927, 1928) crossed the radish, Raphanus sativus, with the cabbage, Brassica oleracea. Despite the fact that the plants were in different genera, he got a sterile hybrid. Some unreduced gametes were formed in the hybrids. This allowed for the production of seed. Plants grown from the seeds were interfertile with each other. They were not interfertile with either parental species. Unfortunately the new plant (genus Raphanobrassica) had the foliage of a radish and the root of a cabbage.\n\nStephanomeira malheurensis\n\nGottlieb (1973) documented the speciation of Stephanomeira malheurensis. He found a single small population (< 250 plants) among a much larger population (> 25,000 plants) of S. exigua in Harney Co., Oregon. Both species are diploid and have the same number of chromosomes (N = 8). S. exigua is an obligate outcrosser exhibiting sporophytic self-incompatibility. S. malheurensis exhibits no self-incompatibility and self-pollinates. Though the two species look very similar, Gottlieb was able to document morphological differences in five characters plus chromosomal differences. F1 hybrids between the species produces only 50% of the seeds and 24% of the pollen that conspecific crosses produced. F2 hybrids showed various developmental abnormalities.\n\nDobzhansky and Pavlovsky (1971) reported a speciation event that occurred in a laboratory culture of Drosophila paulistorum sometime between 1958 and 1963. The culture was descended from a single inseminated female that was captured in the Llanos of Colombia. In 1958 this strain produced fertile hybrids when crossed with conspecifics of different strains from Orinocan. From 1963 onward crosses with Orinocan strains produced only sterile males. Initially no assortative mating or behavioral isolation was seen between the Llanos strain and the Orinocan strains. Later on Dobzhansky produced assortative mating (Dobzhansky 1972).\n\nApple Maggot Fly (Rhagoletis pomonella)\n\nRhagoletis pomonella is a fly that is native to North America. Its normal host is the hawthorn tree. Sometime during the nineteenth century it began to infest apple trees. Since then it has begun to infest cherries, roses, pears and possibly other members of the rosaceae. Quite a bit of work has been done on the differences between flies infesting hawthorn and flies infesting apple. There appear to be differences in host preferences among populations. Offspring of females collected from on of these two hosts are more likely to select that host for oviposition (Prokopy et al. 1988). Genetic differences between flies on these two hosts have been found at 6 out of 13 allozyme loci (Feder et al. 1988, see also McPheron et al. 1988). Laboratory studies have shown an asynchrony in emergence time of adults between these two host races (Smith 1988). Flies from apple trees take about 40 days to mature, whereas flies from hawthorn trees take 54-60 days to mature. This makes sense when we consider that hawthorn fruit tends to mature later in the season that apples. Hybridization studies show that host preferences are inherited, but give no evidence of barriers to mating. This is a very exciting case. It may represent the early stages of a sympatric speciation event (considering the dispersal of R. pomonella to other plants it may even represent the beginning of an adaptive radiation). It is important to note that some of the leading researchers on this question are urging c"

1,"So the moist heat sterilization method uses water at a high pressure. The instrument in which you can run this method is the so called autoclave. This is nothing else than a specialized pressure cooker. The temperature of the steam between 120-150 °C (248-302 F). This temperature combined with the high pressure effectively kill all microorganisms.\nThe dry heat sterilization is using just heat to sterilize your material. You can use fire or heat air for this method. The temperature is definitely higher than the case of moist sterilization (more than 180 °C or 356 F). This destroy all of the large biomolecule contaminants like protein (i.e. RNase enzyme).\n\n\nSo we sterilize the heat sensitive instruments (such as plastic made things) and fluids with the moist heat method while the heat stable (glass) things with dry heat method.\nIf you want to sterilize more heat sensitive things you need to use other (filter-sterilization, chemical decontamination) methods."

1,"ringing in the ears is called Tinnitus \n\nCauses for Tinnitus or ringing in the ear: \n\nAge-related tinnitus causes - hearing loss (presbycusis) occurring usually around age 60. \n\nTrauma-related tinnitus causes - damage to the inner ear (could result from excessive exposure to loud sound). \n\nLong-term use of medications such as aspirin (in large doses), quinine (used in treatment of malaria), antibiotics and anti-inflammatory can be tinnitus causes. Often the unwanted noises disappear once the drugs are discontinued. \n\nTemporomandibular joint problems (jaw disorders resulting in clicking or grating noises) can be one of the tinnitus causes. \n\nOtosclerosis (stiffening of the bones in the middle ear). \n\nTrauma or injury to the head or neck can be a tinnitus cause. \n\nEar wax – Buildup of excess wax in the ear can reduce your ability to hear outside noises, and can be tinnitus causes by causing you to hear internal noises better. \n\nEar infection – If an infection reduces your ability to hear outside noises, you are more likely to hear the noises related to Tinnitus. \n\nAtherosclerosis – Buildup of cholesterol and other fatty deposits causes tinnitus by causing the middle and inner ear to loose its elasticity which causes the blood flow to become more forceful which makes it easier for the ear to detect the beats. \n\nHigh blood pressure – High blood pressure and factors that increase the blood pressure such as stress, alcohol and caffeine are tinnitus causes and can make the sounds more noticeable. \n\nFood--Specific foods may trigger tinnitus. Problem foods include red wine, grain-based spirits, cheese, and chocolate. Tinnitus may also be caused by foods rich in salicylates (the same ingredient as in aspirin, which also causes tinnitus when taken in large amounts).  \n\nGrowths/tumors--Acoustic neuromas, glomous tumors, otosclerosis may all be tinnitus causes. Surgery may be recommended. \n\nStress--Stress is not a direct cause of tinnitus, but it may generally make an already existing case worse. \n\nSince tinnitus might be a symptom of another health problem, see your doctor for any hearing concerns.  Caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, aspirin, antihistamines, and prescription or even over-the-counter medications can aggravate existing tinnitus and are tinnitus causes.  Although there remains no cure, tinnitus symptoms can be overcome.  RingStop is designed to safely relieve and prevent tinnitus and ear noise symptoms."

1,"Magnesium acts as a sacrificial anode.\n\nOxygen in the atmosphere reacts with iron to oxidize it in what is called a redox reaction (oxidation/reduction). The redox reaction is defined by the exchange of electrons--uncharged iron will lose two electrons to an oxygen molecule, creating iron oxide. Water quicken rusting by serving as a catalyst. Dissolved oxygen in the water reacts, and as the water dries, the oxygen becomes increasingly concentrated.\n\nEngineers will prevent wide-spread rusting by creating what is called a ""sacrificial anode."" You might know the names anode and cathode from the ends of a battery. Batteries function by employing two seperate redox reactions, where one end corrodes to release electrons, which travel to the other end and react with metal cations in solution, turning them to a solid metal. The corrosion of iron is prevented by creating a sacrificial anode out of something even more reactive than the iron (usually magnesium). The corrosion of the magnesium releases excess electrons in the iron, which delays corrosion of the iron--oxygen can grab the free electrons created by the corrosion of magnesium without needing to corrode the iron."

1,"Most hydroelectricity is made in dams.  When the water flows through the dam, it spins a turbine (picture a long cylinder).  The turbine has a set of magnets on it, and there is another set of magnets surrounding the turbine.  As the turbine spins, the changing positions of the magnets generate electricity.\n\nIf you're talking about a physical model, I can try to explain it to you, but it's kind of hard without pictures.\nHave a box shape as the dam, tall and wide, but skinny from front to back.  About 1/2 of the way up, there's a hole through the dam, to let the water through.  The turbine is a long cylinder with ""fins"" on one side so that the water can spin it.  The other side (which is separated in order to keep the wires dry) has the magnets on it - three of them evenly spaced around the circumference.  There is another ring around the turbine with another set of three magnets - they should be attached to the dam, not the turbine.  Those magnets will have wires attached, and the wires lead to a power station where the electricity produced is put into a form that we can use.  Look up the Bonneville Dam on an internet search engine - they'll probably have pictures."

1,"The experimental fact verified by experiments with light rays and mirror show that the happenings follow certain laws: If the light ray hits normally it comes back by the same path. If obliquely then it comes back obliquely equally inclined to the normal at the point of incidence and in the same plane of normal and the incident ray. But if you do experiment in which you also measure the intensity of light incident and reflected, then you find that the intensity of reflected light is slightly less. This shows that some light is either absorbed or scattered following no specific laws. Now this is the experimental fact. Now explanations. Explanation depends upon what you assume light to be made up of. If photons, then you know what happens to the table tennis ball when it hits the table without spinning. Same thing should happen to photons. That is how Newton explained  the phenomenon considering light as consisting of particles. He called them corpuscles. But photon is not an ordinary particle in bulk. It is supposed to have dual nature. Its total energy is equal h multiplied by some frequency which is a wave characteristic. Ordinary particle can have all velocities ranging from zero to velocity of light. But photons move with only one  velocity. So in case of bulky table tennis balls we say that they follow these rules of reflection which can be derived from mechanics but lose their little kinetic energy to the table and as sound. In case of photons this is not possible. So we say that if a bunch of photons are incident on a polished surface, there exists a maximum probability of following the laws of reflection, but the probability of the photon getting absorbed or getting scattered in any other direction is vey low but not zero. Similar expalnation can be thought of following the hypothesis that light is electromagnetic wave then we have to take the example of the mechanical waves and see how em wave is differen from them."

Solar tides would only be half as high as normal tides, and they would occur with a regular 12 hour rhythm rather than the monthly rhythm we get now.\n\n2) Tidal pools were NOT the places where land based species first got a foothold. The vast majority of land based species moved form fresh water onto land. This is the reason why earthworms, frogs, snails, mosses, ferns and so forth remain extremely salt intolerant to this day. It is actually very hard for a species to migrate from salt water onto land because it has to cope with the osmotic problems of rain in addition to the stress of dehydration. In comparison moving from freshwater to land requires only improved water retention.\n\n3) It would have been almost impossible for complex life to evolve without the moon. The moon locks the Earth into a stable position WRT the sun. As a result the equator always faces a the sun and the poles have always been perpendicular. Planets that lack large moons wobble, and at times the poles face the sun and the equator rotates perpendicular to the sun. At those times the temperature and light extremes would exterminate all complex life forms. Life would still be possible but every time the axis moved too far from perpendicular it would have to start afresh from deep sea bacteria."

1,"Extrapolate the formula, using the surface temoerature, and instead of the earth distance, substitute the distance you want to caluclate the temperature at.  \n\n\nMeasuring the Sun's Temperature\nOne method, called Wien's law, uses the wavelength of the peak emission, wavelengthpeak, in the Sun's continuous spectrum. The temperature in Kelvin = 2.9 × 106 nanometers/wavelengthpeak.\n\nAnother method uses the flux of energy reaching the Earth and the inverse square law. Recall from the Stellar Properties chapter that the flux is the amount of energy passing through a unit area (e.g., 1 meter2) every second. From the Inverse Square Law of Light Brightness, you find that the solar flux at the Earth's distance = the Sun's surface flux × (Sun's radius/Earth's distance)2 = 1380 Watts/meter2. Since the Sun's photosphere is approximately a thermal radiator, the flux of energy at its surface = sigma × (the Sun's surface temperature)4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Rearranging the equation, the photosphere's temperature = [(solar flux at Earth)/sigma) × (Earth distance/Sun's radius)2]1/4.\n\nThese two methods give a rough temperature for the Sun of about 5800 K. The upper layers of the photosphere are cooler and less dense than the deeper layters, so you see absorption lines in the solar spectrum. Which element absorption lines are present and their strength depends sensitively on the temperature. You can use the absorption line strengths as an accurate temperature probe to measure a temperature of about 5840 K. \n\nRead the link, you'll have to scroll down to come up to the stuff I have cut and paste above.\nst\nHope you find this useful."

1,"Actually, in the social hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) the workers in any colony will all be the DAUGHTERS of the queen.  They are all female.\n\nIn most species, the workers are sterile, and cannot produce their own offspring.  In some of the more 'primitive' species, like Pharaoh ants, the workers can become fertile and can move off to form their own colonies if there is stress on the mother hive - each one becoming a queen.  In many of the more 'advanced' social hymenoptera, the ovipositor (the structure used for laying eggs) becomes modified in the workers into a stinger, since it is no longer needed for egg laying.  The stinger of the honeybee, which is barbed and rips out after stinging is the most derived form of this, but stingers can be found in many wasps, and even ants.\n\nThe males of the hives, known as drones in most social insects have no stinger, because they never had an ovipositor.  The number of males in a hive varies depending on the species.  In some species the drones are indolent wastrels, hanging out in the hive doing nothing just waiting for the call to come perform some sweet sweet lovin' for the queen.  In most species, the males also forage, going out and drinking nectar and the like, but because their numbers are much lower than the worker females of the hive and they don't have the specialized structures such as pollen baskets, their contribution is not as significant.\n\nIn most hives, the number of males is around 10 to 15% of the total population.\n\nMale honeybees can be identified by their long, cylindrical bodies in comparison with the workers, and their two very large compound eyes that nearly meet up on the top of their head.\n\nBecause they are pretty much a drain on the resources, and not required for short-term survival, the males are often kicked out of the hive when food becomes scarce, or when winter begins to draw near.\n\nWithout looking at the genitalia of the ant in question, it may be difficult to determine if it is a drone or not.  If it has wings it is either a queen or a male.  In many ants, the male has a smaller head and larger eyes, but I'm not sure if that applies in all ants or not."

1,It is basically the reverse is true.  All the planets revolving round the sun are trying to move away from the sun.  The sun exerts some magnetic forces that keep the planets revolve in their own orbits.  The forces acting on a planet at a given time are both repulsive and attractive.  They are almost equivalent in magnitude and the difference is very meagre.  They nullify each other and that is why the planets are in place.  More over the planets are they themselves in motion whereby an equilibrium is attained between the motion of planets and that of the sun.\n\nMore over the universe is itself a giant magnetic field which is in space and the planets are kept in motion inside it.  There are many such universes available in space (as per scientists & astronomers).
1,"SMOG.\n\nSmog is a kind of air pollution - the name is a portmanteau of smoke and fog. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area and is caused by a mixture of smoke and sulphur dioxide. In the 1950s a new type of smog, known as photochemical smog, was first described. This is a noxious mixture of air pollutants including the following:\n\nnitrogen oxides, such as nitrogen dioxide \ntropospheric ozone \nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) \nperoxyacyl nitrates (PAN) \nAll of these chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Due to this fact, photochemical smog is considered to be a problem of modern industrialization.\n\nPhotochemical smog is a concern in most major urban centres but, because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well. Smog is caused by a reaction between sunlight and emissions mainly from human activity. Photochemical smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles (called particulate matter) and ground-level ozone. Nitrogen oxides are released in the exhaust of fossil fuel-burning engines in cars, trucks, coal power plants, and industrial manufacturing factories. VOC's are vapors released from gasoline, paints, solvents, pesticides, and other chemicals."

1,The Gulf Stream current is a powerful current of warm water than flows past the tip of southern Florida and up its east coast.  The Gulf Current brings warm water up from the equatorial region creating warmer weather in southern Florida during the winter months.  The current provides a very slight cooling effect during the summer months.\n\nBoth of these effects combine to give southern Florida a warm temperature with little fluctuation from season to season.

1,"Steam generators produce steam not condensation.  A steam generator (e.g., in a nuclear plant) generates steam that can be used to drive a steam turbine to generate mechanical or electric power.  The oldest systems (non-nuclear) discharged the steam wastefully to atmosphere.  In modern plants, exhaust steam from a steam turbine is directed to a steam condenser (where cooling water is used to condense the steam).  This allows the condensed water that must be highly pure and chemically treated to be reused by pumping it back to the steam generator.  More importantly, because the steam condenser reduces the turbine exhaust pressure well below atmospheric pressure, the steam is permitted to expand even more through the turbine blades extracting more power from the steam.  This greatly improves overall system efficiency by providing far more power from the energy expended to produce the steam."

If we were to even slow the proces of aging the world would be a mess and over populate at a rate that could not be substrained thus the balance of the natural order would cause even greater poverty and hunger in the world. So why would we want to even try and slow the ageing process.

1,"The weight (or the mass) of a planet is determined by its gravitational effect on other bodies. Newton's Law of Gravitation states that every bit of matter in the universe attracts every other with a gravitational force that is proportional to its mass. For objects of the size we encounter in everyday life, this force is so minuscule that we don't notice it. However for objects the size of planets or stars, it is of great importance.\n\nIn order to use gravity to find the mass of a planet, we must somehow measure the strength of its ""tug"" on another object. If the planet in question has a moon (a natural satellite), then nature has already done the work for us. By observing the time it takes for the satellite to orbit its primary planet, we can utilize Newton's equations to infer what the mass of the planet must be."

It ranges in brightness from about −2.0 to 5.5 in apparent magnitude, but is not easily seen — its greatest angular separation from the Sun (greatest elongation) is only 28.3° (it can only be seen in twilight). Comparatively little is known about the planet: the only spacecraft to approach Mercury was Mariner 10 from 1974 to 1975, which mapped only 40%–45% of the planet's surface.\n\nPhysically, Mercury is similar in appearance to the Moon as it is heavily cratered. It has no natural satellites and no substantial atmosphere. The planet has a large iron core which generates a magnetic field about 1% as strong as that of the Earth. Surface temperatures on Mercury range from about 90 to 700 K (-180 to 430°C) , with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest.\n\nThe Romans named the planet after the fleet-footed messenger god Mercury, probably for its fast apparent motion in the twilight sky. The astronomical symbol for Mercury, displayed at the top of the infobox, is a stylized version of the god's head and winged hat atop his caduceus, an ancient astrological symbol. Before the 5th century BC, Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects: one visible only at sunrise, the other only at sunset. In India, the planet was named Budha (बुध), after the son of Chandra (the Moon). The Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet as the water star, based on the Five Elements. The Hebrews named it Kokhav Hamah (כוכב חמה), ""the star of the hot one"" (""the hot one"" being the Sun)."

1,"It's difficult to appreciate just how bright the sun is.  Even with the sun 90% covered by the moon, there isn't a strong change in the brightness at the earth's surface beneath it -- less than when the sun is covered by clouds.  Viewing less than 1% of the sun's surface with the naked eye can cause damage.  If you are looking at the sun up to the point of a total solar eclipse, you'll be looking at more than 1% of it until very close to totality.  Also, when the eclipse is finished, enough of the sun to cause eye damage becomes visible very quickly.  Even though it's safe to look at it when the eclipse is total, there isn't sufficient time on either end of totality to cover your eye in order to prevent damage.\n\nAlso, if you are only where the sun is partially covered, definitely do not look at the eclipse.  Use a pinhole camera, or other similar method.  See the link below for a list.  You wouldn't happen to be where you can see the solar eclipse this Wednesday, would you?"

1,"You can start out with two equations:\n\nF = k*M*g   :  Where F (Newtons) is the static friction force of the car, k (unitless) is the coefficient of static friction which we will solve for, g (m/s2) is acceleration due to earth's gravity, and M (kg) is the mass of the car.\n\nFc = M*V^2/R  :  Where Fc (Newtons) is the centripetal force due to circular motion, M (kg) is the mass of the car, V (m/s) is the velocity of the car during the turn, and R (m) is the turn radius.\n\nThe car must maintain its grip on the road to meet the conditions of the problem, so we have to set F = Fc and solve for k, which will give the minimum value to maintain traction.\n\nSo, setting them equal and solving for k gives:\n\nk = V^2/(r*g) = 0.83513...\n\nYou should notice that the car's mass cancels out so we never needed it.  To get the answer, remember to convert 95 kph to meters/second and use 9.81 m/s2 for g.\n\nA value larger than k means that the tires have extra grip and could handle a tighter turn.  Any less than k, and the car's centripetal force would overpower the force of friction of the tires, and the car would slide.\n\nI hope this helped."
1,"The simplest answer is balance.\n\nIt isn't energy - you expend the same whether you're pedalling or walking to achieve the difference in altitude.\n\nHowever, the cadence (rate at which you spin the pedals), and the gearing between your foot speed and the (rear) wheel speed  is a factor in the how fast the wheels move ... and therefore in how good a gyroscope you have. Faster feet (and faster wheel speed) means better balance.\n\nClimbing a hill, you trade off mechanical advantage for foot speed, at the expense of wheel speed. The amount of strength expended to keep the bike upright (by tweaking with your upper body) increases after a certain foot/wheel combination is achieved. Thus it becomes ""harder"" to do.\n\nThe other point of balance has been referred to earlier by another answerer; if the center of gravity (of the system, which includes both the rider and the bike) advances too far forward, there's a loss of balance. The same occurs if it moves too far rearward. At intermediate points, it requires more concentration and percieved effort to keep everything ""rubber side down"" ... thus it appears harder to accomplish some maneuvers on the bike."

1,"Estradiol\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nEstradiol (17-beta estradiol) (also oestradiol) is a sex hormone. Labelled the ""female"" hormone but also present in males it represents the major estrogen in humans. Critical for sexual functioning, estradiol also supports bone growth.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Synthesis \n2 Production \n3 Mechanism of action \n4 Effects \n5 Role in sexual differentiation \n6 Therapy \n6.1 Hormone replacement therapy \n6.2 Blocking estrogens \n6.3 Hormonal Contraception \n7 References \n8 See also \n \n\n\n[edit]\nSynthesis\nEstradiol, like other sex steroids, is derived from cholesterol. After side chain cleavage and either utilizing the delta-5 pathway or the delta-4 pathway androstenedione is the key intermediary. Androstendione is either converted to testosterone which in turn undergoes aromatization to estradiol, or, alternatively, androstendione is aromatized to estrone which is converted to estradiol.\n\nConversion of testosterone to estradiol: \n\n[edit]\nProduction\nDuring the reproductive years most estradiol in women is produced by the granulosa cells of the ovaries by aromatization of testosterone from the theca cells, or conversion of estrone to estradiol. Smaller amounts of estradiol are also produced by the adrenal cortex. In men, the testes produce some estradiol. An additional source of estradiol in both sexes is peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. Particularly fat cells are active to convert precursors to estradiol, and will continue to do so even after the menopause.\n\n[edit]\nMechanism of action\nEstradiol enters cells freely and interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell.\n\n[edit]\nEffects\nEstradiol has many functions, among them are:\n\nBreast development and maintenance \nAdding fat to breasts, hips, thighs during puberty \nImproving bone strength and density \nAccelerating bone maturation and bringing epiphyses to closure, completing growth \nGrowth of the uterus \nDevelopment of the endometrial lining to a thickness necessary to support pregnancy and menstruation \nThinning of cervical mucus at ovulation \nPromoting and maintaining vaginal mucosal thickness and secretions \nServing as the primary feedback to the brain of sex hormone levels in both males and females. \nParticipating in triggering ovulation \nPreservation of egg cells \nEnabling spermatogenesis \nEffect on lipids \nVascular effects \nCerebral effects \n[edit]\nRole in sexual differentiation\nOne of the fascinating twists to mammalian sexual differentiation is that estradiol is one of the two active metabolites of testosterone in males (the other being dihydrotestosterone). Estradiol cannot be transferred readily from the circulation into the brain. Since fetuses of both sexes are exposed to similarly high levels of maternal estradiol, it can play little role in prenatal sexual differentiation. However, testosterone enters the central nervous system more freely and significant amounts are aromatized to estradiol within the brain of most male mammals, including humans. There is now much evidence that the programming of adult male sexual behavior in ""lower mammals,"" (such as mounting rather than lordosis behavior), is largely dependent on estradiol produced in the central nervous system during prenatal life and early infancy from testosterone. We do not yet know whether this process plays a minimal or significant part in human sexual behaviors.\n\n[edit]\nTherapy\n[edit]\nHormone replacement therapy\nIn the event that levels of estradiol in a woman's blood are low (possibly due to menopause or oophorectomy), a hormone replacement therapy may be prescribed, in"
1,"Are you taking into account the fact that the moment of inertia changes once the child jumps on?  In that case you would get that the intial moment of inertia is 1/2MR^2, then once the child jumps on (treating the child as a particle) the moment of inertia becomes 1/2MR^2 + McR^2 where Mc is the mass of the child.  \n\nFrom the information you've provided, that seems to be where you went wrong.

1,"There are many different measures for destructive ability.\n\nTypically this is measured in units of energy.  For bullets, they measure the kinetic energy of the bullet which is then given in Joules (a measure of energy).  For atomic bombs the common measure is kilo-tons which is a measure of energy as well that can be converted to Joules (just a whole lot of them).  A kilo-ton is about 4,200,000,000,000 Joules.  A .45 bullet has about 450 Joules.\n\nLasers also impart energy on their targets.  The measure is typically in megawatts.  A megawatt is 1,000,000 Joules per second that it is applied.\n\nThe number of Joules doesn't tell you quite enough though.  The reason is because a single Joule of energy well aimed, could kill a person, but if you go out running in the sun, you will receive thousands of Joules in a short period of time from the Sun (which is obviously not destroying you).\n\nThe amount of energy that it takes to heat a cup of coffee is considerably more than the amount of energy it takes to fire most bullets, yet you can safely drink the coffee and the energy contained (as heat) within it."

1,"Here is a very simple explanation of the two methods, there are a lot of fine details in each process that are not discussed here.\n\nIn sand casting, a mold of the object to be cast is made using sand that is compacted around the object. The mold is typically in two halves. After the impression is make, the object is removed, the two halves put together and the casting material is poured in. After setting up, the mold is taken apart and the casting removed. In the process, the impression in the sand is lost. To make another casting, the whole procedure is repeated.\n\nFor die casting, a metal mold is made in the reverse shape of the object to be cast. Again the mold is typically in two halves, the halves are joined and the casting material poured in. After cooling, the halves are taken apart and the casting removed. With this method, the mold is still intact so additional copies can be make. Only certain metals, like lead, can be die cast. This method is useful for material like plastics."

1,"The brain's morphology is functionally diverse.  What I mean by this statement is that certain regions/lobes of the brain are devoted to certain activities.  Consciousness, for example, is a product of the activity of the cortex; while respiration (breathing) is derived from the pons/medulla, and vision is processed in the occipital lobe.  The functions of the regions are, for the most part, independent of each other; so, if you ablate one specific lobe of the brain (for example, the occipital), a person would not be able to see (though, yes, his/her eyes would function- but having no center to integrate visual stimuli to would render one blind just the same), but would still breath and think if those centers are unharmed.  The same is true if the brain region responsible for thought processes is ablated: the pons/medulla would still work, since breathing does not require consciousness (ie: you don't have to be conscious in order to breath; hence, you breath in your sleep).  This is also why a comatose person may still be capable of breathing on his/her own, though there may be no conscious thought.\n\nThis is an simplified example, however.  It should be noted that brain function in terms of neural networks and what regions are dependent on each other is not yet fully understood.  The advent of the functional MRI will help science better understand the brain's function in the near future."

1,"wow, people who have no clue try to sound like medical experts.  I'm no medical expert, but I can lead you to a better answer.\n\nTelomere immortalization is one known element of cancer, so I'll use that to explain why smoking is a leading cause of cancer, but just know there are several other things that happen besides this.\n\nBasically cancers are cells that grow, bond, and refuse to die.  We're talking about cells that try to become immortal, and you can understand why.  The carbons and chemicals in your lungs actively block oxygen, which your lungs were designed to need.  Every time your body replaces dead cells (which it does constantly), it checks the environment they're in to see if they need to make adjustments.  Oxygen is essential to cell survival, so if you're choking them to death, they'll get desperate.  Some will just die.  Some will go on gasping for air.  But some will rebel from the body, which is killing them, and find their own mission.  And a tumor is born.  These are like lawless vigilantes who don't give a damn about being part of the body anymore."
1,"""gods_my_ruler"" obviously has NO IDEA what he is talking about.\nOf course you can, easily split H2O into H2 and O2 gas through a process known as ""electrolysis"".  Actually, 12 volts is way over the minimum voltage required to electrolysize water.\nYou will also, of course, need to use some form of electrolyte (commonly, ""salt"", or Na/K Hydroxide are popular choices) in order to help the water conduct electricity since pure water does will not conduct at all.\n\nBut you question was about controlling the current flow.\nI assume you are having problems with the current getting too high and overloading your power supply?\nFor starters, I would downgrade your power source to something with a little less voltage if possible.\nYou can also use combinations of small (on the order or just a few ohms or less) resistors wired in series/parallel in order to give you just the right resistance you are looking for in order to decrease the current through the cell.\n\nWithout more specifics about the problem you are having, that is about all the advice I can give for now.\n\nRemember, it is not the voltage that controls the H2 production rate, it is the current.\nAccording to Ohm's Law,\nV = R*I\nso a higher voltage (with a given resistance) does mean a higher current, but the same goal could be achieved with a lower voltage and much lower resistance.\n\n\nEDIT:\nIn reply to ""kurticus1024"",\n\nUsing a reostat or variable resistor would work to dynamically control the resistance in the circuit, and thus the current through the cell, however, most reostat which I am aware of have a high minimum resistance (i.e.  even when turned all the way to the minimum setting, they are far from zero ohms) so by doing this, you will be DRAMATICALLY increasing the resistance through the cell and intern virctually cutting your cuttent to just a few miliamps.  A few miliamps is fine for many common electrical components whcih the reostat was designed for but if you intend on produce Hydrogen, you are going to have to wait a VERY long time to get any sizeable amount."
1,"If you mean overall efficiency, that is defined as the ratio of energy out to energy in.  Just put a fixed load across the fuel cell (a resistor), log the voltage over time and the mass consumption of hydrogen.  \n\nThe gross heat of combustion of hydrogen is 142 kJ/gm.  This is also called the upper heat.  It accounts for the energy resulting from condensation of the water produced.  Since the water is in liquid form this is correct.  \n\nYou do need to select a load resistor that is well matched to the cell to get maximum power out.  Call this resistor R.  \n\nTo get the efficiency, square all the voltage readings, then add them up, divide by the resistance and multiply by the time between samples.  This gives the total energy out of the cell in joules (if resistance is in ohms and time is in seconds).  \n\nTake the grams of hydrogen used and multiply by the 142000 joule/gm.  This gives the energy in.\n\nDivide energy out by energy in to get the overall efficiency of the cell.  You should expect a number around 50%."

(There wouldn't be a sharp division between night and day for the same reason that there isn't now--because the light is scattered in the atmosphere.)"
1,The black hole will have the same gravitational force on distant objects.  The event horizon is where light cannot escape.  The distance of the event horizon is approximately 2 km (1.24 miles) for every solar mass.  So it would have to have a lot of solar mass to engulf things around it.

1,"Alpha particles are particles that are emitted from radioactive elements.  An alpha particle is nothing more than 2 neutrons and 2 protons, the same thing as a helium nucleus.  If an atom goes through alpha decay, it loses 4 atomic mass units (2 neutrons + 2 protons=4 mass units) and two atomic number values-- the atomic number stands for how many protons there are, so when it goes through alpha decay and loses two protons, the atomic number goes down by two."
1,You could test that rather easily at home by placing a drop of oil on a bar of soap as well as an equal  drop of water and checking for sofening after say 15 minutes.  Of course there are many kinds of oil but only one kind of ordinary water.  I'd bet on the water because water dissolves almost everything.  Actually grease is a mixture of soap and oil but I believe that you must melt the soap to mix it with the oil.  Soap is in fact saponified oil (oil treated with an alkali).  Perhaps hot oil would beat cold water.  But dissolving and mechanically mixing are two very different processes.  Good luck.
1,"The Big Bang theory explains why the universe is moving the way it is.  All of the visible (through telescopes...) matter in the universe is moving in a way that makes it look like it's expanding.  In other words, everything is getting farther apart on average.  By observing the movement, astronomers figured out everything looks like it's all coming from one place, like a big explosion.  They did a bunch of math and calculated everthing came from one place at the same time billions of years ago.  When everything in the whole universe suddenly popped out in one place that's called the Big Bang.  Some people don't agree with the theory because it seems to contradict the creation theory based on how old the universe is."
1,"If you asked a scientist you might get a different answer than if you asked a layman.  Let's compare a kilogram of lead with a kilogram of aluminum.  You likely would use the same scale to measure both samples.  But, the aluminum is much lighter and would take up far more space than the lead.  The samples would displace different amounts of air and the buoyancy of air would affect the scale readings by a small amount.  Therefore to obtain accurate measurements you must weigh the samples in a vacuum or calculate the buoyancy and compensate the weight measurements.  If this is true for lead and aluminum it is even more true for lead and feathers (or even lead and butter).  Chemists often do have to compensate for air buoyancy when measuring chemicals so that when they react none are left over."

Their children survived well with the thumbs, and then the enlarged brain mutation occured next.\n\n\nWhat would be great is a second thumb on the other side of the hand-- that would be very useful. Maybe the next intelligent species will have that. Imagine the amount of work that could be done with two pairs of thumbs.\n\nBefore fingers they were the spiny projections of fish fins. Amphibians had five digit feet and hands. These evolved from fish. From amphibians came early reptiles, and from the reptiles came birds and mammals and even more types reptiles including snakes and lizards, which all use the hands, feet, and appendages differently due to genetic mutation.\n\nSometimes the brains of these animals still contain information on how to use the appendages for unnecessary purposes, like a crippled bird would use its wing arms to help it aid in land locomotion. A snake might be able to twitch its little rudimentary legs which are inside its body if it wanted to.\n\nSometimes these animals may have a mutation where (for example) wings could bear exposed fingers, or rudimentary legs may become grossly elongated. It is up to natural selection whether these mutated animals survive, thrive, or die off.\n\nIn our case, the thumb mutation was beneficial.\n\nThe big toe mutation was sort of unnecessary but it doesn't hold us back at all, really."

Angular momentum is a vector, because w (angular speed) is a vector. How could we describe the difference of the system with w=0 and w not equal to zero? If w=0, then kinetic energy of the system E=0. When they are rotating, kinetic energy of the system E=E1+E2=I1*w1^2/2+I2*w2^2/2, which is not 0, as both w’s are squared. That means you have to do some work to obtain a certain angular speed w no matter what direction disks would spin."

Despite the loner planktonic personaoften bestowed on these creatures, a wide range ofmicroorganisms function, even thrive, in a communitysetting. Moisture and minute fractions of organic matterfound in even the cleanest treated municipal water areenough to initiate and sustain biofilm.Biofilm is known to exist on any surface, smooth orotherwise, where factors for microbial growth are suitable,including pH and temperature. Examples of materials thathave known to give rise to biofilm include stainless steel,glass, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),plumbing and evenleafy vegetables. In some instances, the substrate itself can\n\nprovide organic nutrition for biofilm development, such as plasticizers used in polymer formulations or trace metal nutrients from metallic components.\nThe propensity for microorganisms to form biofilm on\nvirtually any surface presents a formidable challenge to maintaining sanitary conditions, especially as the film becomes more established. The resistance of biofilm to sanitizers increases over time as the film matures.\nLayers of microorganisms have an insulating effect fromsanitizers and the elements, with the outermost reaches protecting the layers of organisms below. When transforming from free-floating organisms to tethered, or sessile, organisms, the protein framework of the cell walls can evolve, hindering some sanitizers by masking or modifying the target sought by the antibiotic.

1,"Where I live now would have been part of a fore arc-subduction complex. At that time the western coast of the area that is now the United States was near the California-Arizona border, and the California-Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada was just starting to rise. A number of islands existed off the west coast that later became part of the North American plate. \n\nThe entire area was just above the equator. The environment was a desert biome. Worldwide, temperatures were warmer than they are today. There were no icecaps on the planet.  The plants that lived in what is now Southern California were dry-adapted (xeromorphic) to live in the hot arid to semi-arid environment.  Some conifers, trees with veined lobed leaves (Ginkophytes), rarely ferns, cycadophytes which look like a palm tree were all likely found growing in microclimates near the coast where there was more rainfall. The most impressive forms of animal life would have been several species of suaropods, which fed on conifers, ginkos and cyads. These were the dinosaurs with long necks and tails. Stegosaurus might have been feeding in the vegetation, and a bipedal carnivore called Ornitholestes may have preyed on them. \n\nSea life would have been abundant, and marine crocodiles may have been common. Large ichthyosaurs (marine reptiles) that reached 2-4 meters made swimming hazardous. Plesiosaurs were also likely to be present in coastal waters and may have preyed on the crocs. Sharks were abundant.  Fish might have been of a group known as bony fish, of which the lungfish and coelacanth are modern survivors. In the air Rhamphorhynchus, a flying reptile probably caught fish like pelicans do today. In shallow sea waters there were some strange looking bivalves known as Diceratids that often built shoals like modern day oysters do. Sea urchins, starfish, and crinoids lived in the shallow and shelf waters. Dragonflies and damselflies were present; also ants, butterflies, and grasshoppers lived in the vegetated areas. \n\n\nTo see a paleogeographic map go here and scroll down to the 150 Ma plate:\nhttp://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/jurpaleo.html\nHere is another map:\nhttp://jan.ucc.nau.edu/rcb7/150NAt.jpg\nBiome map for Late Jurassic:\nhttp://pgap.uchicago.edu/data-models.html\nPaper describing climate of Late Jurassic:\nhttp://www.geo.arizona.edu/~rees/2004-1.pdf"

1,"PSEUDO WORK DONE\nThis is because of the pseudo work done by the inclined surface or plane.\nExplanation:- Let theta be the angle of inclination of the inclined smooth plane and h be its height.Think off an object(body) of weight W=mg is sliding down on the plane. The another force that is acting on the body is force offered by the plane against the weight of the body, let this be R, this force is acting perpendicularly to the inclined plane.Further due to the interaction of forces W & R there exists a resultant force by which the body is sliding down,let it be P,this force is acting along the line of inclination.Now in view of lami`s theorem we have, P=W sin(theta)= mg sin(theta);whence theta is the angle of inclination and 0<or equal to theta <or equal to pi/2.Hence it can be noticed here that sin(theta)is <or equal to 1.\nTherefore P<W ie. mg ( weight of the body).This clearly implies that force less than the weight of the body is enough to slide up to the height h through the inclined plane.For instance when Theta=0 inclined plane will be horizontal,consequently P=0.And when theta = pi/2 ; P will be = mg, this implies that the body falls freely.As a typical example let theta= pi/6.01...,P is< 1/2 mg.Therefore the force -P=-1/2 mg orP=1/2 mg is enough to slide the body to the height h.Accordingly work done by the force while lifting the body to h through inclined plane = 1/2 mgh \nMoreover, as h is the height of the inclined plane,Potential Energy (gravitation potential)at h is = mgh,which is also equal to the work done while lifting the body to the height h, by any path.ie. P.E=mgh. (P.E stands for potential energy).Here true work done is =mgh; work done by P = 1/2 mgh \nie. mgh-1/2mgh=1/2 mgh,This shows that there is a shortage of 1/2 mgh of P.E, when work is done through inclined plane.How to account for this shortage. Actually, there is no bargain in the laws of nature.\nTo account for the above shortage please once again consider lami`s theorem.\nie. R=W cos(theta)= mg cos(theta);where R is the force exerted by the plane on the body, perpendicular to the inclined plane.When theta is pi/6.01, R=1/2 mgh (nearly)\nTherefore pseudo work done by the plane = 1/2mg (nearly)\nie. work done by p + work done by R = True work done\n     1/2mg + 1/2mgh = mgh\nNote-plane is considered as frictionless.\nI think this is enough to understand the phenomenon."

1,"In order to have osmosis first of all you need to have a semi-permeable membrane separating two solutions. In order to have net water movement from one solution to the other you need to have different concentrations of solutes that CANNOT pass through the membrane. These solutes are osmotically active: since they cannot pass through the membrane water has to move in order to equilibrate the osmotic pressures. If they could pass through the membrane then they would just diffuse from one solution to the other until their concentration equilibrates and thus they would not contribute to the generation of osmotic pressure. \n\nSo in two words, osmotically active substances with respect to a given semi-permeable membrane are solutes that cannot pass through the membrane."

1,"IN THE BEGINNIG IF THERE WAS ONE>>>>\n\nIn the Beginning, there was no Beginning because at the time, there was no Time. However, our minds cannot grasp a condition of no-time, so let us pretend that there was a Beginning and begin again: \n\nIn the Beginning, there was THAT WHICH WAS, IS, and ALWAYS WILL BE -- or “IT”, for short.\n\nNow IT was and is both NOTHING and EVERYTHING at the same time. IT was NOTHING because in the Beginning, there were no things--only IT. However, IT was also simultaneously EVERYTHING because IT could be, would be, and always is every thing and all things that can ever exist. IT is infinite CREATIVE POWER with the potential to create anything, to BE anything. But at the beginning, as yet no-thing was created and there was only IT.\n\nAnd because there is only IT, anything that IT should create, IT would have to create it out of ITself. There was-is nothing else to create anything out of. There is not and cannot be that which is not IT. There is only the ONE.\n\nIT is far, far beyond human comprehension and anything we humans say about IT is less than a grain of sand on the Sahara. To even talk about IT, we have to use a comparison, an analogy, of something already within our experience=knowledge. Let’s start with a desert. \nImagine an infinite desert, an infinite plane of pure sand, with absolutely nothing else existing. Our desert is absolutely level without the least depression or the smallest mound. IT is exactly the same everywhere; there is absolutely no distinction, no differentiation, no distinguishing mark, and no landmarks. Even the grains of sand are identical. There is only IT. Infinite in all directions, IT has no limit, no edge--and therefore no center. Or everywhere is the center, depending on how you want to look at it. \n\nNotice that you have absolutely no way of knowing where you are on this plane. There is absolutely no reference point, no center, no edge, no distinctive feature, no landmark to distinguish any point from any other point. There is no relation or relationship—no Relativity--to anything else because there is no-thing else. Without Relativity, you can have no Identity. (The concepts of Relativity and Identity are explained in subsequent chapters.)\n\nIt makes no difference where you are on this plane—there are no differences, remember--because everywhere you are, IT is exactly the same. And no matter how you move or where you go, you are always exactly at the center of an infinity of sameness. Thus, there isn’t any place different to go—everything is the same. Nor can you go anywhere because no matter how you move you are always at the center of an infinity of NOTHING. Without Relativity to some point, to some distinction or landmark, you couldn´t even tell if you are moving or not. Therefore, there is no motion. \n\nPicture all this before you continue.\n\nNow let’s upgrade our analogy to three dimensions. The word and concept that we humans have that most closely corresponds to IT is “ENERGY”. IT is ENERGY with the characteristics of CONSCIOUSNESS, INTELLIGENCE, WILL and CAUSE=CREATOR. \n\nThe highest form of physical energy that we humans can perceive is light. Let’s use light for our analogy and move from two to three dimensions. So now imagine IT as light, as a glowing white fog. Imagine this lighted fog as infinite in all directions with no end, no edge and therefore no center--or everywhere is the center, depending on how you want to look at it. \n\nImagine every part of our fog=IT as exactly the same; there is no variation, no thinning, no concentration, and no differentiation of any kind. There is no distinction, no distinguishing mark, no things, no objects, no waves. There is no gravity or any other force by which to know an orientation or a direction. There is no up-down, left-right, in-out, above-below, north-south, etc.\n\nOur Light-Energy is CONSCIOUSNESS: Consciousness is the awareness, the experience of, existence."

The atoms in the conductor are passing the electrons to the next atom in sequence (current flow in Ampere unit). \n\nAnalogy: \nYou can imagine people in line, passing balls in sequence to the next person until the balls reached the other end.\n\nThe force behind the movement of electrons (potential difference in Volt unit), is due to the excessive supply of electron (negative) from one end and lack of supply (Positive) from the other end. (They flow downstream like water).\n\nImagine if you connect two ends of wire to the positive and negative side of the battery. (But don't do it. That is called; short circuit)\n\nIf the wire is cut in the middle and you connect a light bulb between the two cut ends, The light bulb will glow. \n\nHere is the reason;\n\nBecause the light bulb filament (also a metal but doesn't melt easily) is smaller than the wire conductor and does not easily allow the passage of electron (resistance in Ohm unit), The flow of electron will be restricted to a certain amount (like a bottleneck in a pipe) this restriction will cause heat and light due to friction.\n\nMy best tailored answer for you ;=)"

1,"Albert Einstein's 1905 paper ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"" introduced the special theory of relativity. Special relativity considers that observers in inertial reference frames, which are in uniform motion relative to one another, cannot perform any experiment to determine which one of them is ""stationary"". This is known as the principle of relativity. While this principle was not new to Albert Einstein's work, he found that including electromagnetism in this principle required a new formalism with many surprising consequences. In particular, it required the speed of light in a vacuum to be the same for all these observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the source of the light.\n\nOne of the strengths of special relativity is that it can be derived from only two premises:\n\nThe laws of physics are the same in any inertial frame of reference. This means that the laws of physics observed by a hypothetical observer traveling with a relativistic particle must be the same as those observed by an observer who is stationary in the laboratory. \nThe speed of light in a vacuum is constant (specifically, 299,792,458 meters per second)."

I have been told by several trainers that a person's weight loss is based on 60% diet, 20% excercise, and 20% genetics. If you want to loose weight, cut your caloric intake and increase your excercise. A great place to start is by cutting out empty calories - such as soda, candy, chips, fast food, excessive alcohol intake, you get the idea. Secondly, start walking 20 minutes a day, and try to increase your time by 10 minutes every few days. WW is so great because you immediately see the difference in portion control and calorie intake.

2,"A lot of it is in the technique you use.  Try changing you how thrust, using your lower back instead of the muscles of your hips and buttocks.

For information on how to learn to be like this, I would recommend the book ""Any Man Can"" by William Hartman or ""The Multi-Orgasmic Man"" by Mantak Chia.\n\nNot only should those books teach you how to enjoy multiple orgasms, but they should also provide you with a variety of breathing and mental exercises and techniques to help you prolong intercourse as well."

The antihistamine keeps your body from ""overreacting"" to stuff, which is why it is often used for allergies.  When you use it for the bites, they will itch less and can heal quicker because itching them makes the reaction worse (so DON'T itch them!!!).  I would do that until they go away completely.  If they begin to get bigger (other than just the slight swelling) and the redness/swelling starts to spread out, you should consider re-visting your doctor so they can give you a prescription to better treat them.\n\nI hope this helps!!"

2,"Some women experience symptoms around the time of ovulation. Ovulatory pain, which is felt in one or the other lower abdominal quadrants, may be caused by release of blood or fluid when the dominant follicle ruptures.\nMenstrual pain is linked to a hormone that prompts ovulation. Women who ovulate, or release an egg during monthly cycles, make the hormone progesterone. This hormone boosts the body's level of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractions. As the uterus contracts, it sloughs off the lining. The tissue passes out of the uterus through the cervix."

2,"Brief Summary\n\nFor a minimum of 10 days, drink:\n\n2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice (approx. ½ lemon),\n\n2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) organic Grade B maple syrup, not maple-flavored sugar syrup or syrup from companies that use formaldehyde to harvest their syrup,\n\n1/10 Teaspoon or more cayenne pepper (hot red pepper), and\n\n1 Cup (8 fluid ounces) purified or spring water, NOT fluoridated water.\n\nFor diabetics, there is a section in some editions of The Master Cleanser on using molasses rather than maple syrup in the beginning of the cleanse. Any diabetic should read the book and consult their doctor before beginning the cleanse.\n\nDrink six to twelve glasses of this lemonade mixture daily. No food is eaten nor any vitamin supplements taken during the cleanse. If you get hungry, have another glass of lemonade. After all, this is also called the ""Lemonade Diet.""\n\nIf you are overweight, you may use less maple syrup. If you are underweight, use more maple syrup if you wish.\n\nIf you are worried about losing weight, Burroughs says, ""The only things you can possibly lose are mucus, waste, and disease. Healthy tissue will not be eliminated.""\n\nDo not vary the amount of lemon juice per glass and be sure to drink at least six glasses of lemonade a day. You can drink more water, if you want.\n\nI also strongly recommend you take probiotics AFTER the cleanse to replace the good bacteria you lose when you clean your colon thoroughly. These good bacteria manufacture vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B12, and K and help control bad bacteria, such as Candida. By the way, don't waste your money taking probiotics during the cleanse. They'll just get washed out. Do it after the cleanse.\n\nYou can read more about what probiotics do for you here.\nEnhance Your Elimination\n\nThis is a cleanse as opposed to a weight loss diet. So, you need to ensure you are eliminating the toxins that are being loosened in your system. Cravings, aches, pains, mental irritability and tiredness will turn on as your toxins are mobilized. To eliminate these unpleasant sensations, you need to be sure you have two, three, or more bowel movements a day.\n\nDrink a laxative herb tea each evening. You can find it in your local health food store. I recommend senna tea blend with senna being about half of it by weight. (Senna is an herb that promotes bowel movement.) The kind I've bought warn you not to drink more than two cups per day.\n\nEach morning on an empty stomach, add two teaspoons of non-iodized sea salt to a full quart of water. Do not use ordinary iodized salt as it will not work properly. Drink the entire quart of salt water first thing in the morning. ""Chug"" this — drink it as fast as possible. Within an hour several bowel movements will likely occur. (You'll need to be by a toilet for half an hour to an hour.) If you do not have several bowel movements, try a little more salt in the water the next day until it works.\n\nDrink the herb laxative tea at night to loosen and the salt water each morning to wash it out. If you can't drink the salt water in the morning, drink the herb laxative tea at night and in the morning.\nWant to get all the ingredients easily?\n\nClick here to visit our web store.\nBreaking Your Fast\n\nBreaking a long fast is very, very important. You should ease your way back to solid food after one or two additional days of juices, orange or grapefruit. If you are going back to raw fruits and vegetables, you may do so on the afternoon of the second day.\n\nIf you have been a meat eater and/or milk products consumer, shift to cooked vegetable soup on the afternoon of the second day and a salad for dinner. Keep the lemonade drink as your breakfast drink after that. Of course, you would do better with the least amount of meat and no milk products as they are very productive of mucus and hinder digestion and absorption of nutrients.\nDetox Symptoms\n\nDetoxi"

2,"It depends on what kind of anesthesia you had at the beginning.  It sounds like you had local anesthesia and sedation for a minor procedure.  Local anesthesia is adminstered by the surgeon or doctor performing the procedure.  It's good with certain superficial procedures like stitches and skin lesions, but anything deeper is hard to get numbed completely (ex: pap smear).  That's where the sedation comes in.  The anesthesiologist can give you pain meds and anxiolytic drugs.  They are limited in how much pain medicine they can give you because the side effects are that you get really nauseous and you stop breathing (whereas in general anesthesia you are on a ventilator so it's ok if you don't breath by yourself).  The anxiolytic drug usually is Versed and it's like Valium only faster acting and it usually makes people forget everything for a few hours, and sometimes even makes you forget a few things that happened before you got the injection.  However, it doesn't put you to sleep, it doesn't paralyze you and it doesn't really take away pain, so you were probably awake (but sedated) and feeling enough pain that they decided not to continue.  Once they stopped the procedure you probably didn't have any pain anymore.  \n\nOf note, anesthesia comprises 4 separate aspects, but you don't always need all 4.  For example, for a pap smear in someone who has a lot of pain with the exam, you need pain relief and maybe some amnesia:\npain relief (usually treated with narcotics like fentanyl)\namnesia/hypnosis (from light sedation to unarousable)\nparalysis (for delicate surgeries and abdominal surgeries)\nprevention of harmful reflexes (usually sympathetic nervous system)\n\nLastly, the first answer is too simple, the second answer is pretty good, and the third person is a quack (there is a lot of misinformation around, and the only reliable source is your actual anesthesiologist)."

2,"First of all TEETH ARE NOT BONES.\n\n\nTeeth are depositions of enamel and dentin formed inside a tiny bud that grows(it's called a  tooth bud).  Each bud is formed like a sprout off a chain of sprouts, like leaves on a plant.  You are NOT born with all your teeth already started, but with most of them already started.   Your wisdom teeth are the last to start forming well after birth (I think 6 or 7 years) . \n\nAs part of the eruption process the new tooth (adult tooth) start to eat away the roots of the baby tooth in a controlled manner. as it takes away more and more of the baby tooth root,  the baby tooth becomes looser and falls out.

2,"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a nonvasculitic inflammatory demyelinating condition that bears a striking clinical and pathological resemblance to multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in most instances, ADEM and MS cases occurring in children are readily distinguishable on the basis of clinical features and findings on laboratory investigations. MS is typically a chronic relapsing and remitting disease of young adults, while ADEM is typically a monophasic disease of prepubertal children. Abnormalities of findings on cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin studies are likely in MS but are much less common in ADEM. The onset of ADEM usually occurs in the wake of a clearly identifiable febrile prodromal illness or immunization and in association with prominent constitutional signs and encephalopathy of varied degree, features that are uncommon in MS. \n\nHowever, the division between these processes is indistinct, which is suggestive of a clinical continuum. Moreover, other conditions along the suggested continuum include optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and Devic syndrome, clinical entities that may occur as manifestations of either MS or ADEM. Other boundaries of ADEM merge indistinctly with a wide variety of inflammatory encephalitic and vasculitic illnesses as well as monosymptomatic postinfectious illnesses that should remain distinct from ADEM, such as acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA). A further indistinct boundary is shared by ADEM and Guillain-Barré syndrome and is manifested in cases of Miller-Fisher syndrome and encephalomyeloradiculoneuropathy (EMRN). \n\nSusceptibility to either condition is likely the product of multiple factors, including a complex interrelationship of genetics and exposure to infectious agents and possibly other environmental factors. Of particular interest are the indications that susceptibility to either condition is in part age related. Most cases of either MS or of ADEM possibly occur as the result of an inflammatory response provoked by prepubertal infection with a virus, viral vaccine, or other infectious agent. Typically, the manifestations of ADEM occur quickly after this prepubertal febrile systemic illness and are monophasic. In a minority of cases, patients with ADEM experience 1 or 2 prepubertal recurrences followed by remission. \n\nMS, on the other hand, typically manifests as a relapsing-remitting illness in ensuing adolescence or young adulthood, a significant and unexplained latency of effect with apparent permanency of immunodysregulation. Bouts of MS occur without febrile prodrome. Uncommonly, MS develops in prepubertal individuals and ADEM develops in postpubertal individuals, and some cases of adolescent-onset MS may go into remission. In very rare instances, individuals manifest prepubertal ADEM and, after long latency, MS in adolescence.\n\nHope this helps!"

2,"Causes of Excessive Hair Loss\n\nThe rate of hair shedding in androgenic alopecia is speeded up by three forces: advancing age, an inherited tendency to bald early, and an over-abundance of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the hair follicle. DHT is a highly active form of testosterone, which influences many aspects of manly behavior, from sex drive to aggression. \n\nThe conversion from testosterone to DHT is driven by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase, which is produced in the prostate, various adrenal glands, and the scalp. Over time, the action of DHT causes the hair follicle to degrade and shortens the anagen phase. Thought the follicle is technically still alive and connected to a good blood supply--it can successfully nurture a transplanted follicle which is immune to the effects of DHT--it will grow smaller and smaller (figure 3). Some follicles will gradually die, but most will simply shrink to the size they were when you were born which produce weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, unpigmented vellus sprouts. \n\nHowever, the sebaceous gland attached to it remains the same size. As the hair shafts become smaller, the gland continues to pump out about the same amount of oil. So as your hair thins, you will notice that your hair becomes flatter and oilier. \n\nBut the hormonal link in balding is complex. Eunuchs, who produce no testosterone, never go bald -- even if carrying a baldness gene. However, if castrated men with a family history of baldness are given testosterone, they lose hair in the classic horseshoe-shaped pattern. \n\nStudies show that while balding men don't have higher than average circulating testosterone levels, they do possess above-average amounts of a powerful testosterone derivative, dihydrotestosterone in the scalp follicles. In male balding, genetically primed follicles convert circulating testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which successively diminishes or miniaturizes follicle size, producing ever weaker hairs. With a steadily shorter anagen growing cycle, more hairs are shed, the hairs becoming thinner and thinner until they are too fine to survive daily wear and tear. Balding hair gradually changes from long, thick, coarse, pigmented hair into fine, depigmented vellus sprouts. \n\nOther physiological factors might cause hair loss. Recently, a group of Japanese researcher reported a correlation between excessive sebum in the scalp and hair loss. Excessive sebum often accompanying thinning hair is attributed to an enlargement of the sebaceous gland. They believed excessive sebum causes an high level of 5-alpha reductase and pore clogging, thus malnutrition of the hair root. \n\nAlthough this condition could be hereditary, they believe diet is a more prominent cause. The researchers note that Japanese hair was thick and healthy, with a small gland and little scalp oil, until the occidental habit of consuming animal fat crept into their diet after World War II. This change has led to a significant height increase in the Japanese population, but it has also resulted in more Japanese men losing hair. To some extent, their observation makes sense since problems with greasy hair have often been noted as much as six months to a year prior to when thinning hair becomes noticeable, but this might be just one of the symptoms, not underlying cause, more research is needed. Most doctors agree that if you have a oily scalp with thinning hair, frequent shampooing is advised. shampooing can reduce surface sebum, which contains high levels of testosterone and DHT that may reenter the skin and affect the hair follicle."

2,"First Aid \nFOR MINOR BURNS:\n\nIf the skin is unbroken, run cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water). Keep the area submerged for at least 5 minutes. A clean, cold, wet towel will also help reduce pain. \nCalm and reassure the person. \nAfter flushing or soaking, cover the burn with a dry, sterile bandage or clean dressing. \nProtect the burn from pressure and friction. \nOver-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help relieve pain and swelling. DO NOT give children under 12 aspirin. Once the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion also can help. \nMinor burns will usually heal without further treatment. However, if a second-degree burn covers an area more than 2 to 3 inches in diameter, or if it is located on the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or a major joint, treat the burn as a major burn. \nMake sure the person is up-to-date on tetanus immunization. \n\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000030.htm\n\nPeople have typically treated burns with ice and oil. However, do not use these! Ice of ice water causes loss of body heat and further damages the skin and underlying tissues. Likewise, do not put oil, butter or ointments on blisters or deep burns because these items seal in the heat, do not relieve pain very well. Another do not: do not break open blisters because it makes the skin more prone to infection. \n\nhttp://www.zetatalk.com/health/theal04j.htm"

Or you can take in about a jigger of olive oil before drinking and don't eat too much bar chow while you are at it, if you plan to really drink hard. And after that drinking spree may I recommend a bottle of Gatorade before sleeping to prevent hangover OK."

Wash the bedding in hot water every week. \nDo not use a vaporizer or humidifier unless it is thoroughly cleaned. \nDo not have close contact with pets. Pet owners should bathe their pet weekly. \nThe cleaning of the house or the surroundings should be done by wet mopping rather than sweeping, wherever possible. This avoids the generation of allergen aerosols which could act as a triggering factor. \nThe doctor should be contacted in case the medicines are not effective in keeping the breathing comfortable. \n\nFeel Free to Contact\n\nDr.Mojo"

2,"that depends on how fast you want to gain and if you want it as fat or muscle.\n\nIf you don't really care how you look and are just after weight gain - eat double the portions you are eating now. Concentrate more on protein and carbohydrates. Fast food is a great weight gainer. As well as chocolates, softdrinks, cakes, pastries, donuts, snackfoods, etc. (you know the food I mean) \n\nIf you want to look fit as you gain weight, I'd suggest a weight training program, coupled with increased food intake, not necessarily double your intake. You'll find that when you exercise your appetite also increases. Just feed that craving and exercise and you'll see the pounds come on."

2,"If you do these things, you should lose weight:\n\nDo not eat potatoes, bread, sugar.\nGo easy on pasta and rice if you eat those.\nEat lots of veggies. Get most of your diet from those.\nIf you eat meat, only eat lean meats. Skip the hamburger and fries and choose a salad, perhaps with chicken on it.\nExercise. It sounds like spot exercise would be good for you (like crunches, sit ups) and maybe a treadmill or stair stepper. Walking is the best exercise you could do, so walk instead of ride if you can. Riding a bike is good (if it doesn't have a motor on it). Find an exercise you really enjoy, like hiking, bike riding, tennis. The thing is, get that body moving. (Did you see the movie Matagascar? You got to move it, move it.) Dancing is a great exercise. \n\nIf you do these things, you will lose weight. Remember, if you are tempted to cheat on the routine, you are only cheating yourself. It takes a lot of self discipline, but if you completely give up the sweets and fatty foods, you will find after about 2-3 weeks that you are no longer hungry for them.\n\nJust stay away from the fad diets. At your age they can be so dangerous. If you start living a healthy life now (and it's hard because most kids your age are junk food addicts) you will be much healthier, have more energy, and I think you will be happier. Good luck."

In the last 2 weeks I have no experienced any seizures, spasms or tremors of the hands, legs or arms, and I have had no irritable bowel syndroms symptoms whatsoever!'\nMy sister had a very serious operation 6 weeks ago and had to remain in the hospital for 6 weeks to heal.  She was having very severe headaches to the point she just wanted to die because they were so bad.  I took her a case of goji to drink and she noticed later that night her severe headaches were gone.  All of the medication she was given couldn't stop the pain.  My sister couldn't thank me enough. She took 2 ounces of goji  twice a day.  She is now a goji advocate.  The recommended does for a fibromyalgia suffer is 2 ounces of high-quality goji juice 2 - 3 time per day.  Hope this helps."

2,"there is a study done that IF you drink only bottled water, your body immunity goes down after a while.  This is due to the fact that you are constantly drinking filtered water and your body gets used to having the most essential food/fluid namely water in a very sterile form.  This makes your body get more and more used to a sterile environment and your body reacts to this by getting lazier and lazier.  Think this way, no excercise, your muscles become flab.  Anyway doctors recommend that you drink tap water from time to time just to help build immunity.\n\nI used to think this was false until I started to read up on my pet triton cockatoo.  Many sites said that washing your cage every other day to keep it spic and span is not the best for your bird since it needs to build immunity. And it's not possible in a extremely clean environment.  I think you can apply the same reasoning to bottled water.\n\nAs for the amount, I don't know and have never read it myself.

2,"What you need to know:\nUnless your health care provider advises you otherwise, sex during pregnancy is safe for you and the baby. The baby is protected by the amniotic fluid in the womb and by your abdomen.\n\nSome women with high-risk pregnancies are advised to avoid intercourse during pregnancy. Your health care provider will tell you if you have a high-risk pregnancy.\n\nWhat you can do:\nIf you are concerned, ask your health care provider if it’s okay to have sex.\n\nTalk to your partner about each of your needs and concerns in an open and loving way. If you work together, you can probably figure out how to put a smile on each other’s face.\n\nPositions that work before pregnancy and early in pregnancy can be uncomfortable or even unsafe at later stages of the baby’s development. For example, a woman should avoid lying flat on her back after the fourth month of pregnancy, because the weight of the growing uterus puts pressure on major blood vessels. Fortunately, there are alternatives to the traditional missionary position, such as lying sideways or having the woman on top.\n\nWhen It's Not Safe\n\nIf you engage in oral sex, your partner should not blow air into your vagina. Blowing air can cause an air embolism (a blockage of a blood vessel by an air bubble), which can be potentially fatal for mother and child."
2,"Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive commensal bacteria inhabiting the alimentary canals of humans and animals, are now acknowledged to be organisms capable of causing life-threatening infections in humans, especially in the hospital environment. The existence of enterococci in such a dual role is facilitated, at least in part, by its intrinsic and acquired resistance to virtually all antibiotics currently in use. \n\nThey are resistant to many commonly used antimicrobial agents (aminoglycosides, aztreonam, cephalosporins, clindamycin, the semi-synthetic penicillins nafcillin and oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Exposure to cephalosporins is a particularly important risk factor for colonization and infection with enterococci. Thus, the era in which safe and effective cephalosporins became widely available has also been an era of enterococcal ascendance. \n\nE. facaelis can cause endocarditis, as well as bladder, prostate, and epididymal infections; nervous system infections are less common.\n\nAccording to this website, treatment consists of antibiotics:\n\nhttp://medinfo.ufl.edu/year2/mmid/bms5300/bugs/strfaeca.html"

2,"It does sound as though your brother does have some emotional issues. Your parents should first have him checked out by a physician, maybe it's something organic otherwise I think he might benefit from seeing a psychologist. When my son was a child he used to exhibit almost the same type of behavior you described and when he was in his twenties he started to really behave erratically and was eventually diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenia. It's been a hard road living with him like this but we always knew he was a little different and so I guess we've gotten used to it. If he does have a mental disorder, not only he but the rest of the family should seek help in dealing with this sort of illness. It can be very devastating and although they are doing wonders with therapy and medication, these types of disorders can only be controlled NOT cured.  There is a great book you might want to read, it's called ""When Madness Comes Home"".Good luck."
2,"I'm sorry but as my teachers always said, ""It depends"".  Hospice was with my Granny for about 3  or 4 months and she had the same diagnoses.

2,That's poison ivy alright. It won't spread from the oozing-that's your body fighting the allergic reaction. The plant has an oil called urushiol that binds to skin cells and causes the reaction. There's a fairly new product called Zanfel that will wash the toxin out of your skin. Walmart and many pharmacies carry it. Fairly expensive but it doesn't take much.
2,"Feelings of hopelessness, sorrow, fatigue.  Not wanting to get out of bed in the mornings & being unable to motivate yourself to do so.  Unexplained sadness, crying.

I hope & pray that you will feel better & that you get some help."
2,"You need to call a doctor ASAP.  Pain in the calf and swelling of the leg could be Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  It probably won't be, but it could also be a circulatory or vascular issue that you should have adressed.  Call your personal doctor, ask to speak with a nurse and tell them your symptoms.  They may refer you directly to an urgent care or they will run down a list of questions to 'triage' you and decide when and if you need to come in.  It can't hurt to call if nothing else, for peace of mind."

2,"I wouldn't say that is necessarily true. I think even if you stop having sex and you are being physical in other ways, like walking, situps, crunches and eating in moderation, I think you can maintain a healthy weight.\n\nI've heard that sex does contribute to weight loss, but a lack of it should not cause you to gain weight."
2,"Genetics will predetermine your height RANGE, but not your exact height. Proper nutrition, sufficient protein and calcium will do that.\n\nLook at the Hindus. Their upper caste, the Brahmin, despite being able to afford the best medical care and the best foods, because they eschew meat, are shorties. Average adult male height, 5'5"".\n\nIn the USA, where meat is a staple part of a diet, average adult male height is 5'9"".\n\nSo, if you want a few inches and you're not done growing, eat red meat! The muscle flesh of mammals contain four amino acids not found anywhere else in nature, nor can the body synthesize them from other nutrients. These four amino acids are the necessary components for proteins that aid both bone growth and muscle growth. Result; greater height. \n\nJust make that meat as UNfatty as you can. Trim off all the fat before cooking. Use lean cuts to start with. And stay away from hamburgers. Due to its original positions in the cow, that meat contains fatty acids you don't want!"

2,"Just to be clear: a muscle tear is a strain, not a sprain, and there is no way to know without a medical examination and/or an MRI.  Try using rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medication to decrease pain and inflammation.  If it doesn't get better, see your PCP."

Don't drink that.\n\nPolyethylene Glycol (PEG) is very important clinically.  It is often used as a laxative or even to clean someone out before a large bowel case (colonoscopy, colectomy, etc.).  Okay to drink it but make sure that toilet facilities are nearby.\n\nIf you are scheduled for an upcoming colon case, ask your doc to go with Fleets Phosphasoda instead of PEG.  Fleets = 1.5 ounces X 2 doses.  PEG = an entire gallon!!  They both work equally well for colon preps."
2,"Electroconvulsive therapy is seen as vulgar and out-dated by most people today, but it can be benefitial.  It can have side effects, like memory loss, but the method used today is much different that the primitive technique.  Individuals undergoing ECT barely move now, maybe just a slight toe-twitch or something.  Other forms of treatment - medication and therapy - are likely to be tried first b/c their potential side-effects are generally less extreme.  But before ruling out ECT, it's important to remember that most treatments have side effects, and to consider if you're willing to risk those side effects to find a solution to depression, etc.  If I were depressed and nothing else worked for me, I'd do it."
2,"You are in denial. I quit drinking 5.5 years ago and my husband quit smoking pot 7 years ago and our lives are a million times better than they were. It is a slippery slope.

It's a watse of time and money. Fun? Yes. Relaxing? Can be. But so it a cup of camomile or tension tamer tea. And they don't leave you broke and dull. Good luck."

2,"My twins are the same, but the get worse with their appetites for a few weeks after an illness, particularly if they have been on antibiotics.  We took them to a doctor who also practises natural medicine and he put them on a program that he calls ""weed, seed, feed and maintain.""  The weeding part is getting rid of bad bacteria using something called nilstat and also some olive leaf extract twice a day.  The seed part is dosing up with some probiotics, feed has to do with helping the probiotics work, e.g. having pear juice, and the maintain is basically keeping up the probiotics but not as intensly.  we've seen a huge improvement in their weight gain and their appetites, but I wouldn't advise going on this unless you see a professional, as the doses and the type of probiotics have to be right.  \n\nAlso, we try to make every bite count.  We have found they like meatballs, so I cram as many vegies into them as possible by grating and chopping super-fine and mashing them, and we give them snacks such as corn on the cob sliced into 1-inch long bits.\n\nThe important thing is not to stress in front of him or he will pick up your tension about hois eating.  I made that mistake a bit early on and the twins would act up a bit and even used it as a power thing for a bit, but I manage it a lot better now.  It would be a big worry if the developed eating disorders because of my angst."

As for me, I haven't smoked for a while now, but if i didn't have a job like the one I do now, i would smoke. There hasn't been any prescribed medicine out there that didn't calm me and let me focus. But, That was with taking 1-2 drags of pot. Not smoking a quarter ounce in a day. Smoking that much is what the dr's are talking about when they tell you the serious side effect. Smoke too much, end up dumb. As with any drug, use responsibly. But...Pot is illegal. (boooo)"

They actually live together in the same area without all this hatred that continues between the blacks and whites. What was done to the black people was wrong just like what was done to the Jews was wrong, but continuing to hate either blacks or whites accomplishes two things - more hatred and more prejudice."

2,"AVN of the hip is a situation where the head of the femur loses its blood supply. It can happen for a number of reasons, sometimes the cause is unknown. The reason your doctor is not screaming for you to have surgery is that it is not an emergency. The ball on the femur will eventually regain its blood supply, but the problem is that it can also remodel. If you give you hip total rest the prognosis is good, if you don't the ball will begin to look like a mushroom and then the hip will not function properly. If the ball on the femur does look like a mushroom by the time the blood supply is back that is permanent and you stand a very good chance of getting osteoarthritis in you hip, at this point surgery is needed. So don't freak out just take it easy and listen to your doctor."

2,"I have been checking out ways to relieve soreness my muscles and so has my wife. At one point, we went to an old massuse that used chiropractic techniques as well as many herbal and vitamins. He was somehow able to find that my wife had an ulcer by rubbing her feet (relexology) and then went and pressed on a spot on her stomach that was indeed sore. He said that is an ulcer and if you press right there (how he was & she felt it) that over time it would help her. He did give her a ""tinture""? (spelling) kinda was a tea looking and tasting mixture of certain vitamins that he said she was short on (after taking a saliva sample and testing it).\n\nWe have also been looking at massage chairs and found a thermal (heated) massage bed called Ceragem that has infared heat. The bed is great to lay on and also there are attachments that you can put where ever you want and one that you can sit on. The ceragem bed is kinda spendy to buy (I think about $2500) but there is store near us that allows 1 free visit per day with a 40 minute ""demo"" version. They encourage you to come as many times as you want (once per day). They say that the heat and infared can help with stomach and digestive problems including ulcers. To find a dealer near you to try one out, click on the link and then the map. I honestly prefer the massage of other types of massage chairs better but I do like the strong heat that Ceragem has. I also included a link to see what a foot reflexology chart looks like incase you were curious... I don't know how to recommend a good massuse in your area as honestly there are some that are just ok and some that are just bad ones... good luck. Oh and I know my wife has said that yogurt helps her stomach ""settle"" some when her ulcers have been bothering her."

2,"Cancer isn't just uncontrolled cell growth, because the cells themselves also can become highly abnormal appearing. Cancerous tumors are Graded according to how abnormal they look. A low grade tumor means the cells look somewhat normal under a microscope. The higher the Grade the more abnormal the cell begins to look until it is unrecognizable. A high Grade tumor may be huge and it will have its own blood supply and nutrients . . it basically robs the host body.  What you suggest does not seem possible, since the victim would never survive. Each tumor would be high grade making organs and tissue unrecognizable.

2,"There are no magic supplements out there.  The ones promoted by the ""bodybuilding"" community are scams to sell money - all the top (and most amateur) pro bodybuilders are on some form of ""steroid"" cycle.  If you want to build bigger muscles you need to concentrate on basic lifting exercises such as squats, bench and overhead presses and take the money that you would have spent on supplements and buy good wholesome foods and make sure you eat 3-5 good meals a day.  A protein shake can help you get more calories also - as you are bulking up expect to put on alittle fat, 3 sessions a week of 20-30 minutes of cardio will keep it in check.  When you get to the weight you are happy with you can adjust your diet and exercise to ""cut up"".\n\nAs to the person who says I think I know everything - well I don't but I do have my bacheklor in nutrition and exercise physiol;ogy and have been in the field for over 20 years so I have seen the supplements that supposedly work come and go."

2,the website looks good but i wouldn't pay for there services her are some tips that are probably on there website\n\nIf you follow these tips you will lose weight.\nFirst of all your body can healthly lose only 2-4 lbs a week. Also i would not reccomend one of those diet books or programs because once you lose the weight you will go back to doing what you did before and gain it all back.\nHere is what you need to cut out of your diet or limit.\n-sodas they are empty calories and just add fat.\n-also juices try to limit 1 cup of o.j. has as much sugar as a can of soda.\n-fast food. they provide no nutrients and terrible meals they do have healthly selections at all fast food stores if you pic those you will do much better. \n-junk food is also empty calories its ok now and then just don't over do it.\nHere are foods that you can indulge on.\n-veggies since they are so healthy for you and provide you with many nutrients the calories in them are meaningless.\n-water!! you should drink64oz. a day at first you will pee alot but then you will get used to it.\n-when eating meat try to eat chicken because it is the best.\nother tips\n- try to have baked foods not fried.\n-eat breakfast and try to have it mostly be complex carbs like oatmeal and wheat bread they will give you energy all throughout the day.\n-don't skip meals when you do your body thinks it is being starved so it will hold in more calories instead of burning them.\nWORKING OUT\nyou need to buy some weights or go to a gym and work on increasing your muscles. because that will increase you resting metabolic rate which is how many calories you burn while simply doing nothing and you will see weight loss just from that also doing 50-100 squats(5-10min) will help increase muscle in your legs.\nrunning is also a good way to help your overall apperience.\nand pilates is a good way to tone your body a simple pilates tape done three times a week along with weights and you will see a difference.\n\ngo online and find some healthy meal recipes and use them try to reduce the number of calories you take in daily but not by too much.\nhope this helps you.

2,"Are women who have children healthier than those who don't? \n\nI can't answer with a simple ""Yes"" or ""No"". It depends on what aspect of health you are talking about. \n\nFor instance, women who have been pregnant are at a lower risk for breast cancer relative to women who have not been pregnant (because of reduced exposure to estrogen).\n\nHOWEVER, women who have been pregnant also are at risk for the complications of pregnancy (uterine prolapse, pre-eclampsia, ectopic pregnancies, and the list goes on).\n\nAlso, beyond 'physical health' there are considerations for emotional, psychological, spiritual health that can be impacted by having children or not."

You may even have an infection. If it persists you should seek medical attention. Orange juice throughout the day will help as it cuts through congestion and helps you breathe better. Also, the vitamin C in OJ will help you mend. Your body cannot make vitamin C it relies on the food you eat so if you aren't getting any C then your immune system is deficient. Another thing to consider if you drink alcohol at all  your vitamins and minerals are being destroyed especially the Vitamin B family and vitamin C. So be sure to replenish your B's & C's.

I have not had any headaches since changing to the IUD, but it did take a while for my body to adjust to the hormonal changes.

Although menstrual-like bleeding appears within a week of stopping either pill, menstrual-cycle length may not return to normal until the second or third month after stopping the pill. \n\nThe mini-pill does not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. \n\nThe most common reason women discontinue the mini-pill is irregular menstrual bleeding including skipped periods or no bleeding, unpredictable spotting, irregular bleeding, and sometimes heavier and prolonged bleeding. \n\n\nLast updated August 23, 2005\n\n\n\nCopyright 2001-2006 Aetna Inc."

2,"Hi, while all root canals are not 100% guaranteed to work, they do work the majority of the time.  I have one myself and have never had a problem.  When I was about your age I did not have dental insurance, and was not yet a hygienist.  I had a tooth pulled that could have been saved from a root canal, and boy have I regretted it ever since.  I have now had an implant placed in the area that I had the tooth pulled with a crown on top of the implant.  Cost about 2500 hundred dollars.  That is with my dental professional discount.  If you can save the tooth with a root canal do it.  Not all dentists are trying to scam you, I don't understand this belief.  Do not listen to the above person that said you will loose that tooth and two others.  That is dental ignorance.  If you feel uncomfortable with your dentists diagnosis get a second opinion.  There are no absolutes in dentistry just like the medical profession.  You can never predict how something will work.  There are too many variables.  Patient compliance is a huge part of dental success or failure.  If you are not going to do the work at home to make your dentition better then you may as well not spend the money.  Dentists like doctors are not miracle workers, they can only do what they think is the best course for you.  My advice being a dental professional and a root canal recipient?  Get a second opinion, then If the second opinion matches with the first, go for it.  It will save you aggravation in the end.  The more teeth you lose, the more bone you lose, which ends up making you look older then you are.  You know the sunken cheek look?"
2,"In the spring of 1984 I had a foot long blood clot in my right leg in the calf area.  Blood clots are often referred to as thrombophelbitis meaning a deep vein blood clot.  I was in the hospital for 3 wks and had to remain in bed.  The doctor tested my blood, and he told me I had blood the consistency of frozen ketchup!  So he put me on Coumaden.  He tried the pill form, but it wasn't working, so he gave it to me thru a i.v.  After several days had passed, my blood still wasn't thinning out like he had hoped so in addition to the i.v. Coumaden, he ordered shots of Hepburn several times a day in my stomach area.  After awhile things were starting to look better, until the nurse went to get a sample of my blood and I was bleeding really bad, all over the bed and floor.  The doctor had to eliminate the Hepburn shots and slowly after a period of a few more days, my blood returned to normal again.  \n\nWith modern technology, I am certain by now, the treatment is a lot better than it was back in 1984.\n\nI hope this is helpful to you!  Good luck and I hope you feel better soon!!"
2,With 2 children running around the house I imagine you don't have a whole lot of time for the gym. Yoga & Pilates really work to tone up the mid section. Also watch what you are eating. The easiest way that I have found to shed some pounds is to eat small healthy snacks every 2 hours and eat one meal per day. You don't starve yourself & it gives your metabolism a kick start! Remember great Abs start in the kitchen! Any work out will work if you commit yourself!!!
2,"Aha! A question I actually have an answer for. What has worked for me, besides lots and lots and lots of cardio, is try to target all the muscles near the area, mainly, lower back and the sides of your abs. I go to a gym which has machines that target these areas but I bet you could get good results doing exercises at home on a ball or doing floor exercises. Remember, building muscle will help you burn more calories and make your workouts more effective too!"

The popular name, clergyman's knee, indicates that it is due to a position where the patient kneels more erect than the position that causes housemaid's knee.\n\nTreatment of this condition involves firm bandaging of the knee and avoidance of kneeling. The bursa may need to be aspirated. In chronic bursitis a lump may require excision."

Just because everyone does it doesn't make it normal.\n\nIf you are older there are a few reasons here are the main ones:\n\n- enlarged adenoids or tonsils (but probably adenoids) this requires surgery, but many people do this and have a much happier life, it isn't a big deal, and for most cases the surg. only takes about 45 minutes\n( you could also get your doc to give you corticosteroids to shrink them at first, if you don't want the surgery, but they would have to look inside your nose to establish that the adenoids are the cause, and in most people, Adenoids are the MAIN cause of snoring)\n\n- deviated septum - this means that your nose is disformed on the inside, which you would be able to see if you lifted your head up and looked inside, but if it doesn't look like the midline of your nose is pushed to one side, or sticks out on one side more than the other, you don't have it\n\n- allergies, if you have always had a stuffy nose\n\nthese are the main ones\ntalk to your doctor for best results"

2,"Doctors of Chiropractic receive extensive, demanding professional education on par with medical doctors (MDs) and osteopaths (DOs).\nTo receive the doctor of chiropractic degree, candidates must complete extensive undergraduate prerequisites and four years of graduate-level instruction and internship at an accredited chiropractic institution. Comprehensive knowledge of all systems of the body and diagnostic procedures enable the DC to thoroughly evaluate a patient, address disorders relating to the spine and determine the need for referral to another health care provider.\n\nDoctors of Chiropractic are primary health care providers.\nAccording to the Center for Studies in Health Policy, ""The DC can provide all three levels of primary care interventions and therefore is a primary care provider, as are MDs and DOs. The doctor of chiropractic is a gatekeeper to the health care system and an independent practitioner who provides primary care services. The DC's office is a direct access portal of entry to the full scope of service.""\n\nDoctors of Chiropractic are licensed in all 50 states.\nDCs have been licensed and recognized for many decades in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\nChiropractic is recognized by governmental health care programs.\nChiropractic is included in Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Care Benefits Programs, Federal Workers' Compensation and all state workers' compensation programs. Chiropractic students are qualified to receive federal student loan assistance and DCs are authorized to be commissioned as health care officers in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe practice of chiropractic is based on sound scientific principles.\nThe existence of the nervous system as the primary control mechanism of the body is an undisputed scientific fact. Its relationship with the spine is the focus of the practice of chiropractic. The spine develops in utero to provide two primary functions: (1) allow for freedom of movement and (2) house and protect the spinal cord. When the vertebrae of the spine become misaligned through trauma or repetitive injury, two major consequences will result: (1) the range of motion becomes limited and (2) spinal nerves emerging from the spinal cord are compromised. DCs use the term ""subluxation"" to describe such disruptions. Interruption of nerve flow can eventually lead to pain, disability, and an overall decrease in the quality of life. Conversely, the removal of that interference has been shown to have significant, lasting health benefits. Through the adjustment of the subluxation, the doctor of chiropractic endeavors to restore normal nerve expression. The body is then able to respond appropriately to any imbalance in the system, thus relieving symptoms and restoring health.\n\nDoctors of chiropractic provide effective, low-cost health care for a wide range of conditions.\nStudies conducted according to the highest scientific standards and published by organizations not affiliated in any way with chiropractic institutions or associations continue to show the clinical appropriateness and effectiveness of chiropractic care. One of the most recent, funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health, stated emphatically that:\n\n""On the evidence, particularly the most scientifically valid clinical studies, spinal manipulation applied by chiropractors is shown to be more effective than alternative treatments for low back pain...There would be highly significant cost savings if more management of low back pain was transferred from physician to chiropractors.""\n\nThe doctor of chiropractic is an effective source of preventative and wellness care.\nThe anatomical focus of the DC on the human spine has created the perception of the DC as just a ""back doctor."" Although this perception is not entirely incorrect, it is very much incomplete. Doctors of chiropractic are a highly appropriate resource in matters of work-place safety, st"

2,"Along with what the others said on sinuses and the like, I'd like to point out that often cold weather accompanies dry weather. (as there is less H2O in the air when it's cold because of less evaporation and so on)\n\nSo, that air low in humidity may ""dryen"" the inside of your nose, wich is meant to be humid, thus causing pain and maybe even bleeding. The same as your lips get cracky and dry in winter time. \nAlso, the blood vessels in our inner nose tissue are somehow fragile. Breathing really really cold air may ""burn"" them by the cold a little, and thus the pain.\n\nI'm not an expert tough, but maybe a good scarf could improve things up! :)\n\nIn any ways, good luck with your problem! ^_^"

2,"I think the product you are talking about is called Silveron, which is an excellent material to use with post-operative site infections to promote healing, treat the current infection and prevent others.   The strips contain minute amounts of actual silver, which have a antimicrobial property.  A doctor could also be using Silvadine cream with packing material to do the same thing. With either product, you get healing going again and eliminate infection.  The wound is  going to heal from the inside outwards.  Normally this is what happens, except the stitches hold the skin closed and you just don't see it happen.  In your daughter's case, the site got infected and the stitches had to be removed- so the skin has an opening.  Because it was infected, the doctor won't want to replace the stitches, but he also doesn't want to just leave the open wound unprotected.  That's the reason for the packing, to provide the protection her skin would have normally provided while the tissue beneath heals.\n   It's hard to give an exact time frame for her to completely heal, because that is a pretty individual thing.  In a child, healing is usually quicker than for an adult, even after an infection.  You can do some things to help it along, like giving a good multivitamin, and keeping clothing from covering the area or rubbing against the bandaging as much as possible.  She should eat a good balanced diet, and simply rest.    I would think it should heal well enough within a week or so to no longer need the packing, and then the doctor will probably put on steristrips to hold the outer layer of skin closed, instead of the stitches- so the outside scar will be a little nicer in appearance.  Once she no longer needs the packing strips you can start gentle applications of vitamin E oil to the area to encourage the skin to heal nicer. For that just poke a hole in the end of a regular vitamin E gelcap and squeeze it out to the skin.  A few drops will do, and it's easily absorbed by the skin.  Try to have her avoid waistbands that go across the site for a while, until it is really well healed, as it will be a sensative patch for a while yet.\n  It's hard to say why it became infected, but that will make it take longer to heal overall because the body has to fight the infection and recover from the surgery at the same time.  The infection is in the area where the healing has to take place, which is a sort of double whammy for the poor cells trying to repair everything.  The packing material will help take some of the pressure off the healing tissues by doing some of the antibacterial/microbial defense for them, so they can concentrate on the healing and repair side of things.   Usually once you start packing a wound, it heals pretty well within a week or so.\n  I feel sympathy for you and her.    I did not have a postoperative site infection with mine, I just didn't absorb the sutures under the muscle lining, and they had to be rejected over the next few months.  My original incision healed, but then continued to break in spots as the suture material surfaced and came out.  It was nearly six months before I could stand a waistband of any sort on it, and I had to swap over my undies for the old high waistband variety and buy looser fit jeans for a while.  So I have some idea how she must feel, and how frustrated it is getting to be for you both.   Take heart that it should start to show improvement now, and she should heal fairly rapidly now.  Good luck to you both!"

In addition to making you sterile (which is possible, but there is no guarantee that it is doing this to you), it can also cause heart disease and cancer, not to mention make you look and sound like a man.\n\nSo as I said, there is no guarantee that steriods are making you sterile, so you should use some form of birth control.

2,"Dude.  You can't speed up your metabolism to where its so fast that you can eat anything and not gain weight. \n\nPut simply in order to speed your metabolism up to the max you need to learn to train yourself to eat right.\n\nEating right means more than just eating the right foods, it means eating the right amounts, and more importantly at the right times.\n\nYou should shoot for SIX, count 'em, SIX meals a day, spaced out 3 hours from one another.  \n\nThe reason that most people stay so fat is that they have their bodies trained to store fat.  When you eat the wrong foods or only eat 3 times a day or allow yourself to become too ""hungry"" during the day, your body goes into a ""Starvation"" mode where it saves up all the fat in reserve so that it will have something to sustain itself on just in case it doesn't get anymore food.\n\nIf you train your body to understand that its going to get food on a regular basis, once every couple of hours, it will begin to initiate a fat-burning process that will continue on throughout the day, at times when you are active, and even when you are just sitting still.\n\nApart from eating right you must drink lots, and lots of water.  And it has to be COLD water.  I mean at the very least you have to drink 80 oz. per day if possible at least half your body weight (meaning if you weigh 200 lbs, drink 100 oz).  I personally drink a gallon or more when possible.  \n\nWater is nature's fat-burner.  When I say this I mean that drinking cold water will have a thermogenic effect on your body..  as in, a heat-producing effect.  This production of heat burns fat because your body has to warm that cold water up to match your body temperature and also to restore the balance of water in your body.  \n\nI could go on about this forever but I think thats enough.\n\nResistance training (weight-lifting) is great  like your friend recommended, and cardio is even better when you combine both.\n\nBut anyways, you can eat anything you want, on perhaps ONE day out of the month.  Any more than that and you better plan on putting in some serious hours at the gym and on the treadmill.\n\nMetabolism alone won't keep you from gaining weight.  Not only that, but without the diet/exercise plan you can actually end up losing whatever musculature you have.  \n\nAnyways, Good luck mate."
2,"Eat regularly. Avoid skipping meals or starving yourself. Include planned,\nhealthy snacks into your eating plan. Sugar cravings get more intense\nwhen you’re over-hungry.\n• Eat more complex carbohydrates, especially high fiber, whole grain\nproducts. Minimize simple sugars and refined products. Cakes, cookies,\nsweets, white rice, white bread, and white pasta may cause an “insulin\nreaction” which makes you feel sluggish and crave more sugar.\n• Include a good source of protein and/or healthy fat with each meal.\nProtein and fat are digested more slowly and give satiety to meals.\n• Cut back on caffeine. Caffeine wreaks havok with blood sugar levels,\nincreasing the chance of overeating later.\nHave you got a sweet tooth that never seems to get its fill?  If so, take a look at your diet. Have you eaten foods that are high in simple, fast absorbing carbohydrates?  \n\nIf so, fast absorbing carbs equals an overload of glucose in the blood.  Insulin pushes out the glucose, thus creating low blood sugar in some individuals.  \n\nSolution:  Better management of blood sugar, smarter food choices and eating at regular intervals. And it wouldn't hurt to get your blood sugar evaluated by your doctor."

2,"A yeast infection, also known as candidiasis (pronounced: can-dih-dy-uh-sis), is the name for a common infection caused by a type of yeast-like fungus called Candida. Small numbers of Candida are always present in our bodies, but normally we have the right balance of bacteria and other factors to keep them from growing too much. Sometimes, though, these yeast-like fungi do grow too much, and this can cause an infection. These infections usually occur in warm, moist parts of the body, such as the mouth and moist areas of skin. When they cause an infection in the vagina, it is known as vulvovaginal candidiasis.\n \nCandida can overgrow for many reasons. Stress, pregnancy, and illnesses that affect your immune system may allow yeast to multiply, as can certain medicines. These include some birth control pills and steroids. Or if you're taking antibiotics, such as for strep throat, the antibiotics can kill ""good"" bacteria that also live in the body and normally keep the growth of Candida in the vagina in check. Yeast also flourish if a girl's blood sugar is high. Girls who have diabetes that isn't controlled are at a higher risk for yeast infections.\n \nMany girls find that yeast infections tend to show up right before they get their periods because of the hormonal changes that come with the menstrual cycle. Clothes (especially underwear) that are too tight or are made of materials like nylon that trap heat and moisture might lead to yeast infections because yeast can thrive in this type of environment. And douching and using scented sanitary products can upset the balance in the vagina and make yeast infections more likely.\n \nIt's common for girls who are not sexually active to get yeast infections. Although yeast infections are not considered sexually transmitted diseases, they can occasionally be spread from one sexual partner to the other. This is quite rare, however, and the partner of someone who has a yeast infection does not automatically have to be treated"

How do you know if you should call 911? \n\nSome chest pains are minor problems such as muscle aches and gas bubbles. Others are more serious such as an inflammation of the lining of the heart or lungs, ulcers, gallbladder attack, acid reflux or blood clots to the lung. \n\nMost importantly, some pains can be the only warning sign of a life-threatening heart attack, where a few minutes can make the difference between life or death. \n\nHeart pains generally are located under the breastbone or across the upper chest. They may also go down either arm (not just the left arm), up to the neck or jaw, or through to the back. \n\nMost people describe heart pain as a deep pressure, ache, burning or squeezing. Some say it is like a belt tightening around their chest or a heavy brick laying on them. Rarely is heart pain sharp like a knife or excruciating like hitting your thumb with a hammer. \n\nOften heart pain is accompanied by other symptoms, most commonly profuse sweating, nausea, dizziness or difficulty breathing. \n\nHeart pains are often provoked or worsened by emotional stress or physical activity, but they can also come on when you are doing nothing more than reading or watching TV. They don't come and go in a few seconds, rather heart pains generally build up and go away over a minute or two. \n\nDonít goof around with chest pains. Stop doing whatever you are doing. Don't wait until morning to see if they will be better.

2,"Hi, Claude - Hopefully I can clarify some of the misconceptions on here.  Under ordinary circumstances, when a person is at rest, there is very little variation in the time interval from one heartbeat to the next.  Sometimes, the heart rate can become somewhat irregular.  There are several reasons why this can happen including premature beats (which are almost always very benign), heart block (sometimes benign, sometimes more problematic), and atrial fibrillation (which can put patients at risk for strokes).  As you can see, it is impossible to say whether your irregular heart rate is dangerous without knowing which of these arrhythmias you may be having.  The way to make the diagnosis is to check an EKG or, if your symptoms come and go, have you wear a Holter monitor or event monitor to capture these episodes.  I recommend that you see your doctor about this so that he/she can tell you whether the irregular heart rate needs to be addressed.  Good luck!"

2,"A health professional can perform this procedure better. A lubricated, gloved finger is inserted into your rectum and pressed several times on your prostate. This may need to be done 2 or 3 times a week. Why this works is not certain, but it is believed that the massage helps open blocked ducts in the prostate, improving circulation and antibiotic penetration into the prostate. Prostatic massage is not done for acute bacterial prostatitis because it could cause the bacteria to spread from the prostate and cause a wider infection (sepsis)."

2,"DO NOT FAST!!!!!!! Our bodies need food to work properly. That is why we get hungry. Every organ of our bodies need the nutrients in the foods we eat. If you fast your body starts to eat itself. Look at the people in Etheopia. They HAVE to fast because they don't get food. Yeah they're skinny, but do they look healthy? They look withdrawn, sick, sad. When you eat a healthy balanced diet, you feel good, you look good, your skin glows, you're less likely to get sick, you boost your immune system, your organs and brain functions at top notch. When you starve....it's exactly the opposite. If you laid in bed all day and did nothing....your body burns about 1100 calories just to survive. This includes thinking, breathing, heart beating. If you fast...where is your body gonna get that energy? Not all from fat! It will be muscle."

2,"Cutting is often reported by those who do so, as a form of ""release"" from actually feeling NOTHING AT ALL. For others, it is an attempt to redirect the pain.  Some others do use it as a form of self punishment. It depends. Whatever the reason, it is not always just a representation of childhood grievances; like one of the others here said, you can have a fine childhood. BUT, if you have a mental illness which can be purely organic/biological then cutting is a symptom of some pretty serious personality disorders. Either way, a cutter's suffering is great and should not be taunted because of it. Many go to great lengths to hide it and are ashamed.  If you know someone with this behavior, they need help and support soon. People who are cutters have a very high rate of suicide, although the cutting itself does not often represent a suicide attempt but some have accidentally resulted in such because they cut too deep."

2,"The Cause of Type 1 Diabetes\n\nAutoimmune reactions, in which the body's white blood cells harm its own tissues, cause many diseases including type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and arthritis, among others. We don’t known why immune cells target certain organs, and why in type 1 diabetes, only insulin-producing cells are killed.\n\nIn type 1 diabetes, the body's immune T-cells react against beta cells -- the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas -- effectively shutting them down and triggering disease onset.\n\nSo, it is known that type 1 diabetes is caused by the body's immune system turning against cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. What's remained unclear is the target for this immune response.\n\nSome studies report that albumin, the protein in milk, is a causal agent for that immune reaction. Also some theories point toward viruses. The glutamic acid decarboxylase is another molecule that has been believed to be the cause for that reaction.\n\nNow, after eight long years of careful research, scientists believe they've finally pegged insulin as the prime antigen -- immune system target -- responsible for this shutdown.\n\nDr. David A. Hafler, Breakstone professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School guided the research, which appears in the May issue of Nature. Unfortunately, the only way to adequately answer that question in humans is to examine tough-to-obtain pancreatic lymph tissues.\n\n""It took us years to get these tissues, to clone the cells and then to really characterize them and examine their activity,"" he said. “The results of that effort show that indeed the target -- the cause -- of type 1 diabetes may be T-cell reactivity to insulin,"" Hafler said.\n\nHis team in Miami has been testing insulin as a potential basis for a vaccine against type 1 diabetes. However, another expert in type 1 diabetes research, Edwin Gale --who is professor of diabetic medicine and head of the department of clinical science at the University of Bristol in England-- cautioned that a potent vaccine against the illness remains a distant goal.\n\nThese findings are very interesting for people with type 1 diabetes, but not for those with type 2 diabetes, since although in both cases the result is hyperglycemia, the causes are different. Reports Health Day News\n\n\nWhat Causes Type 2 Diabetes\n\nType 2 diabetes affects about 200 million people worldwide and has a predicted increase to 300 million by 2025. Also, nowadays more and more children and adolescents are developing Type 2 diabetes, which used affect mostly adults in the past.\n\nRecent studies reveal that genetics, obesity, fetal history, lack of activity, a diet high in fat and stress, all may play a role in the development diabetes.\n\nGenetic studies have shown that the association of some genes is the root of the cause of Type 2 diabetes. A healthy and active lifestyle for the whole family of a person with diabetes is then greatly recommended to protect their children and young people.\n\nLow birth weight has also been associated with Type 2 diabetes. It seems that poor nourishment of the fetus increases the risk of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes.\nIf that baby is overfed and becomes overweight during childhood, then the risk is a lot higher.\n\nOn the other hand, stress has been associated with insulin resistance, which leads to Type 2 diabetes. This happens due to the cascade of metabolic reactions that our emergency hormones trigger when we are stressed.\n\nObesity has long been associated with diabetes, as well as the lack of physical activity and a diet high in fat. This is thought to cause a condition called insulin resistance.\n\nWhat is insulin resistance?\n\nInsulin resistance means that your muscles, fat, and liver cells cannot use insulin properly. There can be a lot of insulin circulating, but the cells are incapable of using it to allow glucose entering the cells and be conv"
2,"good for you for not wanting to change what you eat - you're already on the right track: exercise!\n\nI recommend some all-body exercises: swimming and jump-rope.\n\nHowever I also recommend measuring your waistline or similar if you are trying to ""loose weight"" because you are most likely shedding fat but putting on muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat, so you are probably getting slimmer without loosing actual weight, which is perfectly normal and healthy."

Read the detail sheet that comes with the med, it basically says the med doesn't do squat....lol.\n\nAnyway, zinc supplementation is the only treatment ever found that reduces the length of a cold, once you have it.  Supplementation with immune boosting vitamins etc. like vitamin C, help....if you take them regularly BEFORE you get sick but do nothing after you get sick.  In contrast, research published in the New England Journal of Medicine a few years ago, basically proved that taking zinc after you get a cold, basically cuts the duration of the cold in half, on average.\n\nAnother supplement that might work is something called beta 1,3/1,6-glucan.  This is a highly purified extract from yeast cell walls.  It is a powerful, general immune system stimulant.  It has shown to be dramatically effective in animal studies against dangerous diseases like anthrax.  No studies with the common cold that I am aware of, but I'm willing to bet it's effective because of its mechanism of action."

2,"Showering after sex should not have anything to do with preventing a UTI.  It's the not urinating after sex that can contribute to that.  But, I do understand that many recommend staying laying down when TTC.  So, right before you have sex, make sure you have emptied your bladder.  Avoid rough sex.  Try using a lubricant like KY.  Make sure you shower BEFORE sex and that your butt is scrupulously clean.  Always wipe from front to back (and using wipes after a bowel movement is an excellent habit to get into).  Avoid wearing thong underwear.  Never put anything near the vagina that has been near the anus.  Get cranberry pills from a health food store or online and take them every day.  Most UTI's are caused by bacteria from the anal area getting into the urinary tract.  Some people have honeymoon cystitis which is from having a lot of sex or rough sex that irritates the urethra and can make it more suseptible to infection.  But MOST UTI's can be prevented with scrupulous hygiene.  If you have had frequent UTI's in the past, you may feel like you are having another one, but it can be bladder spasms caused by previous insult to the bladder.  Sex can aggrevate and bring on those spasms.  The next time you think you have gotten a UTI from sex, have your urine tested by your doc (or they do have OTC tests now) to see if indeed it is a UTI.  There are medications for bladder spasms, but they have side effects and should probably not be taken if you may be pregnant anyway.  Good luck!!"

2,"A topic that I feel is very important for the patient and community is patient confidentiality. This is something where both patients and community need to be aware of and repsect the confidentiality of others because everyone has the right to their own privacy. People love to gossip, so sometimes if someone in healthcare or someone happens to see someone in the hospital, they will go and tell their friends and it spreads like wildfire. A lot of times people don't want others to know their health problems or have people also spread false information about who they see in the hospital which causes that patient more grief when they are approached with this false information. So i feel that teaching the patients and community to respect the rights of privacy of others is one of the most important type of ethical issues that can be addressed."

I hope this is what you where looking for\n\n During a cold, sinus, or throat infection or an allergy attack, the eustachian tubes, which connect the middle ear to the throat, can become blocked. This stops fluid from draining from the middle ear. This fluid is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria or viruses to grow into an ear infection\n\nEar pain (mild to severe). Babies often pull or tug at their ears when they have an earache. When the fluid in the middle ear builds up, the eardrum may burst (rupture). Once it ruptures, the fluid drains, and the pain usually stops. The hole in the eardrum often heals by itself in a few weeks. \nFever. \nDrainage from the ear that is thick and yellow.

But unfortunately many homes are not capable of giving the necessary love (and even worse, may be abusive) so the children need to learn coping skills to deal with their respective situations.

2,"Ever do drugs? \n\nI'd get a second opinion, if I were you...just in case. \n\nUnexplained mental problems are nothing to mess around with. This really is something that only a doctor should give you advice on, nobody here is qualified to give you a diagnosis regardless of their profession. It would be nothing but speculation and you really need to be checked out in person."
2,"I'm a dentist.\n\nI find it absolutely hilarious that three dental assistants would answer a question about ""what makes a good dental assistant"".\n\nObviously, personality goes a long way.  Your personality should be similar to that of the doctor with whom you work.  If you're loud and rambunctious and your doctor is quiet and reserved, he/she will not like you.\n\nAppearance is important.  If you look like a punk, you'll be treated like one and your stay in the practice will be short-lived.  We run a doctor's office, and our staff should dress and carry themselves accordingly.\n\nAbility is also paramount.  Some assistants don't know where to put the suction and don't know how to retract the cheek.  Furthermore, some assistants are great at keeping the doctor's mirror clean.  Others are terrible in that respect.  Furthermore, a good dental assistant will never let the doctor ""work underwater"".  Being skilled at keeping the tooth dry is of paramount importance.\n\nKnowing how to take good x-rays.  Unless the practice uses digital x-rays, an assistant who has to repeat x-rays is more of a detriment to the doctor than a help.  Simply ""getting"" the tooth on the film isn't enough.  The tooth shouldn't be elongated or shortened much in the film.\n\nKnowing your instruments.  There are few things more frustrating than asking an assistant for a Potts or a Woodson Periostial during a difficult surgery case and receiving a blank stare.  When you start in your new practice, learn the names of all of the instruments ASAP, and know what they are used for.  Do whatever you can to memorize this stuff.  I work with assistants who have been in the practice longer than I have and STILL don't know some of the things I ask for.  It's annoying, and it's shameful.  But I love the ones who know the instruments and their uses.\n\nHaving things set-up properly.  Don't cut corners.  If your doctor is doing endo, have everything set up.  It's exquisitely annoying when I reach for the endo handpiece and, oops, it's not there.  Or when I'm placing a composite filling and, oops, the curing light isn't there.\n\nNever pass blame on to someone else.  That kind of nonsense doesn't fly with us.  We don't care who forgot to replace the burs in the bur block, and we don't care who forgot to re-stock the anesthetic in that operatory.  If you're assisting with the procedure, it's YOUR responsibility to make sure that everything we need is there.\n\nShow initiative, and take responsibility for the upkeep of the operatories.  I cannot tell you how many times I've worked on patients where I had no light coming from the handpiece because the bulbs on the hoses burned out.  If I didn't mention it to the assistants, I could work for 10 years before any of them noticed it.  Look around and see what needs to be fixed, replaced, cleaned, etc.  You are the ones who keep us running smoothly.\n\nNEVER try to diagnose patients.  Some of the more experienced (or gutsy) assistants try.  They seem to think that over the years they've heard us say to patients pretty-much everything there is to know about the science of dentistry, and therefore able to usurp some of the diagnostic responsibility.  When you try to diagnose, you are going to be partially wrong or completely wrong on anything that isn't just plain obvious...even if you're an experienced assistant.  When the doctor comes in and gives the patient the diagnosis, the patient responds, ""but your assistant said....."".  We hate that.  We don't want our patients being primed with ideas in their heads that we wouldn't want there.  Let the doctor do the diagnosing.\n\nNever predict treatments.  Never tell a patient ""you are probably going to need a root canal on this tooth"" unless the doctor told you to inform the patient.  I've had assistants do this and it i"

2,"A history of HPV infection is believed to be a prerequisite for the development of cervical cancer; according to the American Cancer Society, women with no history of the virus do not develop this type of cancer. However, most HPV infections do not progress to cervical cancer. Because the process of transforming normal cervical cells into cancerous ones is slow, cancer occurs in people who have been infected with HPV for a long time, usually over a decade (Greenblatt, 2005; Sinal and Woods, 2005).\n\nHigh-risk HPV types 16 and 18 are together responsible for over 70% of cervical cancer cases (Baseman and Koutsky, 2005; Cohen, 2005). Type 16 causes 41 to 54% of cervical cancers (Noel et al., 2001; Baseman and Koutsky, 2005) and is also the usual cause of VIN (Edwards et al., 2005) and oropharyngeal cancers (Bolt et al., 2005).\n\nIf a woman has cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or abnormal (possibly precancerous) cervical cells, a Pap smear can detect them. It is particularly important for women who have abnormal cervical cells to undergo colposcopy so that precancerous and cancerous lesions can be detected and treated early. \n\nSource(s):\n\nhttp://www.wikipedia.com \nThe condition of mild dysplasia or an ascus pap smear result will usually indicte the presence of the high risk strains of HPV genital wart viruses. When diagnosed with this condition it is recommended to have Pap smears and colposcopy every 4-6 months. Treatment is seldom recommended, because the progress to advanced stages usually takes several years and can easily be detected. The disease is linked to the sexually transmitted Human papilloma virus, which causes abnormal cells development. The condition of mild dysplasia or an ascus pap smear result will usually indicte the presence of the high risk strains of HPV genital wart viruses."

2,"Almost everyone agrees that water is good for you and that the biggest problem with water intake is that you don't drink enough. We have all had it drummed into us that we need to drink at least eight glasses of water a day. That it's important to drink water before and during exercise. \n\nThat coffee and tea don't count because caffeine can dehydrate our bodies. And that you can't trust your thirst as an accurate measure of when you need water since if you're thirsty you're already dehydrated. Well think again. According to a recent review in the Journal of Physiology, most of these accepted truths seem to be myths. \n\n This review looked at the scientific evidence of the 8*8 mantra � drinking at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, and found that there really was none. \n\nThe claimed benefits of taking in that much water each day, including benefits for weight loss, bowels, fatigue, arthritis, mental alertness and headaches, losing weight, preventing constipation, are also mostly unsubstantiated. \n\nOther Water Myths That Are Debunked In This Article Include: \n\n\nBy the time a person is thirsty that person is already dehydrated. This in fact isn't true and the best measure of how much water to drink is your thirst. \n\nDark urine means dehydration. Again that's not strictly true either as there are many other factors that can contribute to dark urine. \n\nCaffeinated beverages dehydrate us. As you'd expect much of this is also unsubstantiated. In fact, contrary to popular opinion, a recent study has found that coffee, tea and sodas are hydrating for people used to caffeine and thus should count toward their daily fluid total. \nWhile this review focuses on the validity of the various water myths, no one seriously disputes that getting enough water is crucial. However, fears of dehydration and the constant barrage telling us we don't drink enough water, has led to a mistaken belief that the safe thing to do is to drink as much and as often as possible. But drinking too much water can be hazardous to your health. \n\n\nToo Much Water?\n \n\nThe reason why over hydrating can be dangerous is that when we consume large amounts of water when exercising, blood plasma (the liquid part of blood) increases, while the sodium concentration in the body fluids decreases, both as a result of the dilution by the water but also because sodium is lost by sweating. \n\nHyponatremia, or low blood sodium, generally happens after drinking too much plain water and can lead to adverse effects and tissue damage, and interfere with brain, heart, and muscle function. \n\n Early symptoms can be difficult to spot and include: \n\n\nConfusion \nNausea \nFatigue \nMuscle cramps \nWeakness\nMore severe symptoms can include vomiting, muscle twitching, delirium, seizures, coma and death. \n\nA new review of three deaths of US military recruits highlights the dangers of drinking too much water. Like in sports, the military has traditionally focused on dangers of not drinking enough, especially under conditions often associated with exercise and hot conditions. However, getting overzealous over the need to drink large amounts of water and over-hydrating can have deadly consequences. \n\n\nSo How Much Water Should You Drink.\n \n\nMy recommendation is to drink when you're thirsty, and if you think you should be drinking more, don't overdo it. As far as drinking water in and around exercise, I've outlined a few simple guidelines that will make sure you're well hydrated without hitting any extremes. \n\nWithin an hour or so of training, drink a few glasses of water so you start well hydrated. While training you can drink a glass or so of water for every 15 minutes you train, especially if you're sweating it out. \n\nHowever, even during times of heavy sweating don't take in more than a quart and half of water per hour. As far as how much your daily intake of water should be, The Americ"

2,"Well reducing them slightly and/or temporarily is the best you can hope for, though if you are young, you will find that they shrink over time anyway (and that you may miss them when the lack of excess sebum is no longer present to delay signs of aging)\n\nI know of one very effective way to do what you're asking for but since you specifically requested a ""natural remedy""  ...here's the best I know of:\n\n*Tea. Green Tea, as well as some other kinds (peppermint, i have heard) will help calm and smooth the skin and reduce enlarged pores by using them as a cool rinse or applying them as a mask--- you can get creative here, and there are many ""recipes"" available online if you search for them. Think of cucumber slices to reduce puffy eyes...  that sort of effect is what you'll achieve with tea.\n\n*Tea Tree Oil.   Malaleuca alternifolia -This is what I personally use. Don't let the 'oil' part scare you into thinking it will cause a breakout or clog your pores...   a lot of the fear some dermatologists and beauty product manufactures try to invoke in women about oil being comedogenic is actually a really effective way of causing women to over-dry their skin which is the best way to end up with a break out {and essentially said dermatologists and manufactures rake in profit as these women find themselves with worsening skin). \n\nThe size of your pores, however, is genetic, and while it may not seem like a thing called ""tea tree oil"" would do anything for your skin but make it oily, let me assure you, try it one time and you will find the effects of the oil are comparable to that of rubbing alcohol, at least in the way your skin feels when applying it.\nIt can run expensive, though, not really if you consider how long it takes to use up a $9 bottle.  You can try the ""tea tree oil"" line of products from The Body Body Shop"" for free using one of their free testers just to see what I mean [keep in mind that The Body Shop uses a formula of 15% Tea Tree Oil and 85% Alcohol and Water, etc...  -not exactly natural)\nBut should you decide to try real Tea Tree Oil you can buy it in a pure bottled form, from Walgreens or Rite Aid or wherever your local pharmacy/corner store of choice is and make sure it says 100% Tea Tree Oil in the ingredients. How you use it, is up to you- it is very versatile, and you may want to experiment (over time, too much at once will be unpleasant)--  but examples of common applications are as an addition to soap or foundation, as a toner, as a light moisturizer, as a mask (also check out the homemade aspirin mask recommended by users of Makeupalley.com--do a search there and you'll see what I mean- but obviously, that isn't natural, so back to the tea tree oil-->)\n\nIt is an antibacterial oil, and yet it does still moisturize, preventing your skin from producing more oil out of dryness (which will happen if you over-dry your skin.  and that only adds to the size of your pores, or so it would appear anyway.)  \nBe aware however that if you have dry skin (and I suspect that if you have large pores that dry skin is not your ailment) then Tea Tree Oil would not be a good solution, it isn't THAT moisturizing, and regardless of what kind of skin you do have it will sting.  IT WILL STING.  -just making sure -don't get it anywhere near your eyes, though common sense alone would perish the thought [as would your sense of smell the moment you open the bottle] -Same goes for the lips and the inside of your nose-- these will not be pleasantly effected by the strong effects of the oil and you can dilute it in olive oil to decrease the strength.  You may also use an alternative to olive oil, but make sure that whatever oil you do choose is an oil that will not have a molecular size too large or it may actually clog your pores... but olive oil is a safe bet. You can tell whether or not it is safe by how cold it had to get before it solidifies"

If you are fourteen, I am suprised that you and your mother have not had discussions about your period and what to do if it occurs.  Just go to your mother, explain to her that you feel that you may be having your first period and trust that she will help you get the products and instruction that you need."

2,"Your question is almost strange and maybe unclear too.\nAside from the other answers you have already got till now, I can only add something about some risk, in the case you are interested in it.\nYou know that with the sexual intercourses many illnesses can be transmitted easily.\nThere are a lot :\nHIV, Candidiasis,  Blennorrhea, Syphilis, etc. etc.\nOf course, it depends on the partner health.\nHere’s because the use of the condom is always advised for occasional acts with different and unknown people.\nOf course, the act itself, as like as the wank, has no effect towards our health."
2,"Hi there\n\nPlease go see your local doctor. What you have is a complication from taking blood. With any procedure there is risks. \n\nHere the nurse has inserted the needle and a few things could have occurred - \n\n1. the needle has gone through the vein and pierced your nerve which will give you a pins and needles sensation, usually going away in a week.\n\n2. the needle has gone through the vein and instead of blood being able to be withdrawn into the needle, it has leaked into the surrounding tissue near your elbow joint.\n\nYou describe the latter problem to a certain degree. When there is pressure caused by the leaking of blood, this will affect circulation to anything that is distal to it - in simple terms this means your hand will be cooler, maybe slightly darker in color.. your nailbeds may not be the same pink color but dusky/dark compared to the other arm. Also due to pressure you may experience more pins and needles or pain. The blood that has leaked into the tissues will eventually be absorbed into your body again but you are looking a few weeks away. Potentially if the tear in the vein is large, the blood wont stop leaking and pressure will continue to happen... acting like a torniquet in your elbow area. If the complications you are experiencing continue, then potentially an operation is needed to relieve the pressure and fix the bleeding point.\n\nBasically, go to your doctor so that he can see a baseline view of your arm and symptoms. If they get worse then an ultrasound of your arm will be necessary to assess the problem more accurately so that the apprpriate intervention can be put in place.\n\nUnfortunately this is a common occurrence of taking blood, although your symptoms describe it a bit more serious.\n\nGood luck"

2,"Infectious arthritis causes pain and swelling in the joints. Joints are the places where two or more bones come together. The pain and swelling is called inflammation. \nThe inflammation is caused by a germ. The germ can be a bacterium (back-teer-e-um), a virus, or a fungus. \nInfectious arthritis normally affects only one joint, but sometimes affects more. \nIt does not usually last a long time if it is treated early. Infectious arthritis is a form of joint inflammation caused by a germ. The germ can be a bacterium, a virus or a fungus. Infection of the joints usually occurs after a previous infection elsewhere in the body. \n\nThere is usually only one joint involved, though sometimes two or three joints can become infected. Mostly, infectious arthritis affects the large joints (shoulders, hips, knees), but smaller joints (fingers, ankles) can also be involved. \n\nBoth men and women can get infectious arthritis. \nIt can affect people of any age. \nSome people are more likely to get infectious arthritis than others. For example, a person who has an illness that makes it harder to fight off other infections may be more at risk. \nPeople with an existing arthritis are also more likely to develop infectious arthritis, because germs tend to infect a joint that is damaged, and therefore weaker than a healthy one. If a person has had surgery to replace a joint with an artificial one, this can also provide a slight chance of infection developing. If it does, it usually occurs a short time after the surgical procedure. However, it is not unheard of for infection to show up in a person years after having joint replacement surgery. \n\nSome of the stronger medications used to treat certain types of inflammatory arthritis also lower the body's resistance to infection, making it easier for infectious arthritis to take hold. \n\nPeople who work in jobs where exposure to animals, plants, marine life and soil is common also have a higher chance of contracting infectious arthritis."

2,"If you don't have an STD, there's a chance you are experiencing dyspareunia, that is, a condition in which women experience pain during sexual intercourse. it's a rather common condition, and easily tratable. If you went to the doctor and there's no medical reason for your pain, it would be a good idea to talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, or some counselor with GOOD sexual education experience. Usually fears and embarrasment makes us feel pain when we shouldn't. Or maybe, you had some bad sexual experience before, and you're afraid to experience that again.\n\nDon't worry, with some professional help, you'll solve it in no time."

2,"If you suspect that you have hyperthyroidism, you should really see a doctor.  You shouldn't depend on the looney-tunes here on Yahoo! Answers.  But if you just want background information:\n\nHyperthyroidism:\n\nCauses:  Hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis occurs when the thyroid releases too many of its hormones over a short (acute) or long (chronic) period of time. Many diseases and conditions can cause this problem, including:\n\n    * Graves' disease\n    * Non-cancerous growths of the thyroid gland or pituitary gland\n    * Tumors of the testes or ovaries\n    * Inflammation (irritation and swelling) of the thyroid due to viral infections or other causes\n    * Ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone\n    * Ingestion of excessive iodine\n\nGraves' disease accounts for 85% of all cases of hyperthyroidism.\n\nSymptoms:\n    * Weight loss\n    * Increased appetite\n    * Nervousness\n    * Restlessness\n    * Heat intolerance\n    * Increased sweating\n    * Fatigue\n    * Frequent bowel movements\n    * Menstrual irregularities in women\n    * Goiter (visibly enlarged thyroid) may be present\n\nTreatment:  Treatment varies depending on the cause of the condition and the severity of symptoms. Hyperthyroidism is usually treated with antithyroid medications, radioactive iodine (which destroys the thyroid and thus stops the excess production of hormones), or surgery to remove the thyroid.\n\nIf the thyroid must be removed with radiation or surgery, replacement thyroid hormones must be taken for the rest of the person's life.\n\nBeta-blockers like propranolol are used to treat some of the symptoms including rapid heart rate, sweating, and anxiety until the hyperthyroidism can be controlled.\n\nP.S.  I'm not a doctor.  All of this information is from publicly available sources on the internet."

So I went to a Chiropractor and he found that my hip was out of place making one leg longer then the other.  It did not hurt to have him pop it back in place.

2,"If you treat it properly, it wont affect you at all...\nRead more about astigmatism here:\nIn optics, astigmatism is when an optical system has different foci for rays that propagate in two perpendicular planes. If an optical system with astigmatism is used to form an image of a cross, the vertical and horizontal lines will be in sharp focus at two different distances.\n\nThere are two distinct forms of astigmatism. The first is a third-order aberration, which occurs for objects (or parts of objects) away from the optical axis. This form of aberration occurs even when the optical system is perfectly symmetrical. This is often referred to as a ""monochromatic aberration"", because it occurs even for light of a single wavelength. This terminology may be misleading, however, as the amount of aberration can vary strongly with wavelength in an optical system.\n\nfull story\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"

2,"Well it may take a bit of practice before you get it in right, especially if you are a virgin. But it is easier to do it if you are sitting down. Don't force it, just try to find a comfortable position, it will be kinda upward and back, you can't just shove it straight up there. The important thing is to relax, because if you are tense it will be harder to insert. I hope you are using one with an applicator...that also helps. Make sure you are not using one that is too large. Start out with a Jr or regular absorbency tampon at first, even if you have a heacier cycle, just so you can get used to putting it in. I hope this helps! You feel so much cleaner with them, especially now that its getting hot outside!!! Oh and with the applicator, you push it in until the first section goes in, and then you push the applicator so the tampon goes in. You should not feel the tampon once its in place. If you feel it and it feels uncomfortable, you most likely don't have it in far enough. Its not likely that you will push it in too far. Just check and make sure you can reach the string, for when its time to take it out."

Running would burn the same amount of calories in slightly less time; running up stairs or cycling uphill would burn even more (but I don't run, too painful for the joints).

2,"Vaccinations USED TO contain a preservative called thimerosal.  This is what many people suspected cause the increase in rates of Autism.  I have my doubts about that, but that's irrelevant because they stopped putting thimerosal in children's vaccines around the year 2000.  The last lots of vaccines which contain thimerosal as a preservative expired by early 2003. So that's one thing you don't have to worry about.\n\nA child may experienc rash, fever & general feeling of 'yuckiness' after the jab.  More severe side effects are possible, but very rare.  \n\nSome people suggest giving the children the vaccines separately.  There are pros & cons of this.  It is more expensive, for one thing."
2,"I'll try to use a simple talk.\nAntibiotics work to kill bacteria. Bacteria are single-cell organisms. If bacteria make it past our immune systems and start reproducing inside our bodies, they cause disease. We want to kill the bacteria to eliminate the disease. \nAn antibiotic is a selective poison. It has been chosen so that it will kill the desired bacteria, but not the cells in your body. Each different type of antibiotic affects different bacteria in different ways. For example, an antibiotic might inhibit a bacterium's ability to turn glucose into energy, or its ability to construct its cell wall. When this happens, the bacterium dies instead of reproducing. At the same time, the antibiotic acts only on the bacterium's cell-wall-building mechanism, not on a normal cell's. Ok?"
2,The reason they don't want you donating with a pulse rate that high is because when you lose blood volume your heart rate will increase anyway to compensate.

If the doctor thinks the bacteria can be found in the bloodstream, he/she could take some blood from you and send it off for culture.

2,"No don't go there how can it be healthy and maintainable if it's out of a box. I have a plan that will definately work for you and can easily fit into anyones lifestyle. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. You can do a circuit class but this counts as one weights session. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, boxing and spin. If your classes are less than 1 hour top it up with cardio before and after classes. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone."

2,"Well, the short answer is that it depends to a large degree on which stage it is caught in.  \n\nI found a link with a ton of information on the subject, including prognosis, symptoms, and treatments.

2,"You can't follow BMI 100%, it doesn't account for body type.  It is a good general indicator though.\n\nYou are 13 and 135lbs and 5'.  Don't go too crazy, you are still growing.\n\nYou can't lose 5-10lbs a day, don't bother trying.  If you are serious about losing weight, do your research.\n\n1.  Don't replace 1 soda a day, replace all sodas everyday (if you drink a lot of soda, cutting it out can make a huge difference right away).  Drink about a gallon of water daily (it is also a mild appetite suppresant=help you eat less)\n2.  Exercise 30 min to 1hr 4-5x a week.  Cardio (running, elliptical machine, stair machine, bike, etc).  Join a sports team or sign up for some activity like karate.\n3.  Can't just eat Lean Cuisine's and Lean Pockets.  Changing a diet is basically a lifestyle change.  Eat things like grilled chicken, veggies, etc. Don't eat junk food, no fast food (if you eat a lot of fast food, cutting that out of your diet will make a huge difference immediately)\n4.  Depends on the person, but cutting out sodas and fast food can cut down your daily caloric intake big time also.\n\n\nUse the internet!  Do your research!!  Read health forums online! \n\nGood luck!"
2,"I had West Nile (Meningitis) last August.  Symptoms lasted through November.  There are 3 phases, West Nile Virus Fever (mild flu-like symptoms), West Nile Meningitis which affects the external brain membranes and West Nile Encephalitis which is the most deadly form.  There is great debate as to whether or not a person becomes immune from becoming symptomatic once they've had the virus.  The reason is that the virus has not been in this country long enough to do true studies. There is a wonderful site to go to with other West Nile Survivors ... we all listen to each other and answer questions about our own experiences with this virus:http://p102.ezboard.com/bwestnilevirussurvivorsfoundation"

My hematologist never even brought up that subject.  \n\nAnyways, I know how your are feeling, just take care, everything will go well!"
2,"I had a bout of pleurisy that gave me similar symptoms. The symptoms can include:\nFever \nCough \nChills \nShortness of breath \nWeight loss \nPoor appetite \nSharp chest pain with breathing. Pain can limit the movement on the side of the chest with pleurisy. The pain can also be in the back around where the lungs are. \nRapid shallow breaths \nInability to take a deep breath \nItching in sites on the back (near the site of the lungs, but no visible rashes) \n\nSince the symptoms are similar to a heart attack, I urge you to see a doctor for evaluation. An EKG can rule out the heart attack pretty quickly."

2,"Type 2 diabetes almost always has a slow onset (often years), but in type 1, particularly in children, onset may be quite fast (weeks or months). Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often polyuria (frequent urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst, and consequent increased fluid intake). There may also be weight loss (despite normal or increased eating), increased appetite, and irreducible fatigue. These symptoms may also manifest in Type 2 diabetes in patients who present with frank poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nThirst develops because of osmotic effects — sufficiently high glucose (above the 'renal threshold') in the blood is excreted by the kidneys but this requires water to carry it and causes increased fluid loss, which must be replaced. The lost blood volume will be replaced from water held inside body cells, causing dehydration.\n\nAnother common presenting symptom is altered vision. Prolonged high blood glucose causes changes in the shape of the lens in the eye, leading to blurred vision and, perhaps, a visit to an optometrist. All unexplained quick changes in eyesight should force a fasting blood glucose test. These are now quick (less than 5 minutes total), inexpensive (materials less than USD $1), and can be safely performed by almost anyone with trivial training.\n\nEspecially dangerous symptoms in diabetics include the smell of acetone on the patient's breath (a sign of ketoacidosis), Kussmaul breathing (a rapid, deep breathing), and any altered state of consciousness or arousal (hostility and mania are both possible, as is confusion and lethargy). The most dangerous form of altered consciousness is the so-called ""diabetic coma"" which produces unconsciousness. Early symptoms of impending diabetic coma include polyuria, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with lethargy and somnolence a later development, progressing to unconsciousness and death if untreated."

2,"The type of protein you eat may play a role in successful weight loss and in your overall health. \n\nConsumption of large quantities of processed meats such as hot dogs, sausages, and deli meats, have been linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer, Hu says. You'll have a harder time maintaining weight loss if you eat these proteins often, and you may be damaging your body. \n\n\nHu and other nutrition experts recommend getting dietary proteins from the following sources: \n\nFish: Fish offers heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids and, in general, less fat than meat. \n\nPoultry: You can eliminate most of the saturated fat by removing the skin. \n\nBeans: Beans contain more protein than any other vegetable protein. Plus, they're loaded with fiber that helps you feel full for hours. \n\nNuts: One ounce of almonds gives you 6 grams of protein, nearly as much protein as one ounce of broiled ribeye steak. \n\nWhole grains: A slice of whole wheat bread gives you 3 grams of protein, plus valuable fiber. \n\n\n""A lot of plant-based foods like soy and legumes can give you the same amount of protein as meats. I have nuts for breakfast every day, because they not only give you a lot of protein, but they're healthy sources of fat,"" Hu says. \n\nSo when you decide to cut carbs and boost protein, take Hu's advice: Don't lose sight of the big picture. \n\nPublished March 31, 2004."

2,"This is most likely due to plantar fasciitis, which is a fairly common foot problem. The best way to help prevent this is by stretching before you go to bed and before you stand up in the morning. Put a towel around the ball of your foot and push your heal down to stretch the tendons on the bottom of your foot. Do that regularly, twice a day. If that doesn't still doesn't help, you can buy sleeping splints that hold your ankle at a 90 degree angle. Another thing that also tends to help this and most foot problems are proper insoles for your shoes. If you do a lot of running or walking, look into getting a set of superfeet for your running shoes."

2,"Sorry to hear that you are going troubled times. But yes. People can surely get thru' this. Remember one thing. ""Tough times never last long. Tough people will"". If you look at the lives of all great men, you'd see that they overcame thousands of obstacles to get to where they were. Abraham Lincoln is a prime example. If possible, read their biography. That will surely help you.\n\nTroubles come into our life for a reason. They are there to give us a new perspective or to help us discover our hidden power which we haven't discovered yet. So, dont be discouraged. At the end of all the problems, you'd emerge as a much stronger person.So, hang in there. Try to talk to your friends/people who wont let you sulk. Try to join a church or a spiritual group which would help in giving you a different perspective. Try to look at the brighter side of things when things look down. Look at how happy you'd be when all problems are solved. Having a positive attitude and looking at the brighter side of things helps getting thru' times like this.\n\nI'd suggest that you do the following. Look at the problems and prioritize them. Dont look at all problems at the same time. Tackle one thing at a time. Give priority to problems that can't be postponed and try to resolve them. Again, try to look at the brighter side of things. Things will be in a better shape soon. A couple of stanzas from HW Longfellow's ""The psalm of life"" to keep you going.\n\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\nIs our destined end or way ;\nBut to act, that each to-morrow\nFind us farther than to-day.\n\nIn the world's broad field of battle,\nIn the bivouac of Life,\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle !\nBe a hero in the strife !\n\nLives of great men all remind us\nWe can make our lives sublime,\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\nFootprints on the sands of time ;\n\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\nSailing o'er life's solemn main,\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\nSeeing, shall take heart again.\n\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\nWith a heart for any fate ;\nStill achieving, still pursuing,\nLearn to labor and to wait."

Sometimes bleeding can happen while pregnant, but it is not a period. Note the color of the blood.

2,"Good suggestions here already, but perhaps I could add:\n\nHerbs:  passionflower, hops, camomile, baical skullcap, oatstraw, motherwort.  This last plant is known for its nurturing effect, although in Florida might be hard to find.  Its Latin name is leonurus cardiaca, so its slight beneficial effect on blood pressure and on heart palpitations has been known since ancient times.\n\nI'll add valerian with a special note:  it's generally used for insomnia or anxiety, but it has a counter-effect with a small minority of people - it speeds them up instead of calming them.  So if you try valerian I'd try it alone, not in any combination, so you can determine whether you belong to the majority or the minority group.\n\nTo nourish the adrenal glands, which in turn will permit one to tolerate stress better:  oatstraw and nettles.  Nettles as in stinging nettles.  One of the most beneficial herbs in the plant kingdom.  Contrary to its common name, plant has a slightly sweet flavour.  Chock full of vitamins & minerals, more than spinach or broccoli.\n\nOne can usually find combinations of these herbs in tea preparations or in tincture form.  If you get to Washington state you can probably find wild nettles growing in the countryside, or someone who knows how to find & harvest them.  Make nettle soup, as north Europeans did for centuries in the spring - it perked them up after long winters without fresh veggies.\n\nFlower essences:  in addition to Rescue Remedy, there's also mustard flower essence (for grief) and bleeding heart flower essence (mourning something that's lost).\n\nWould you have time to try yoga?  Or even just to read Yoga Journal in a library, it's inspiring to read about people practising yoga to grow their minds and spirits as well as their bodies."

A polyp is a swelling or excrescence (tumor) emanating from a mucous membrane; commonly found in vascular organs such as the nose, uterus, colon, and rectum. Polyps bleed easily; if there is a possibility that they will become malignant, they should be removed surgically. \n\nSo to answer your question a sessile polyp is a tumor with no stem and it is attached directly to the affected area."

2,"Easy-peasy. You will love this.\n\nYou just have to work out how many calories you need per day - depending on whether you're male or female. If you want to lose weight, then cut about 500 calories off that total (so if you're a guy and your recommended calorie intake is 2000 then just make it 1500). Divide by 5 which gives you 300. All you do then is eat five meals during the day at regular intervals. You could have breakfast at 7, a mid morning meal at 10, lunch at 1, mid afternoon meal at 4, and dinner at 7. This means that you never go into starvation mode (which will encourage your body to hang on to fat reserves) and instead you kick start your metabolism into working properly. If you keep at it (and remember to eat proteins too as well as your salads and other ordinary healthy stuff) within a week you will start to feel better. It keeps your brain alert, your body working properly, and you will feel healthier and fitter. Remember to drink lots of water - about 2 litres a day especially if you're constantly working so as to flush out the build up of toxins and waste products from your internal organs.\n\nCombine that with exercise. Even an hour's walk every evening will be better than nothing - heck even just an hour three evenings a week. Once you start to feel better you will find more motivation to exercise and to make time for it too.\n\nIt works. It really does. None of these silly diet fads or starving oneself stupid - the body needs to be fed good stuff and on a regular basis for it to work at its optimal performance. It needs water. It needs exercise. And you don't need expensive diet foods either - they're a complete scam and don't do you any good.\n\nGo for it!! 8-]"
2,"Try reading a bit on both Dependent Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder; along with Anxiety Disorders as these (the varied anxiety disorders) address irrational beliefs/fears.    Your question, based upon what you wrote afterwards, sounds less about ""creating fear"" and more about ""filling a void...a hole in our soul"" so to speak.  We need to learn to tackle our fears in ways that are not destructive to ourselves or others, facing them, journaling about them, talking to someone we trust and feel very safe with.  A direct answer to the question you posed, in my opinion, would be, ""Yes.  We can obsess over our fears of impending doom or losing someone, etc.  That obsession can then immobilize us with overwhelming fear and anxiety.""  Hope that helps."

2,"Well, what you've described are sort of the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but not really, so I don't understand the question. What you describe would barely count as cyclothymia, to be honest. Have you been diagnosed as bipolar, or do you just think you may be?\n\nHere's the lowdown: OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. In recent years bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the persons judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.\n\nIf this really isn't you, then be thankful. Best wishes."
2,"WHAT IS LUCID DREAMING?\n\nLucid dreaming means dreaming while knowing that you are dreaming. The term was coined by Frederik van Eeden  who used the word ""lucid"" in the sense of mental clarity. Lucidity usually begins in the midst of a dream when the dreamer realizes that the experience is not occurring in physical reality, but is a dream. Often this realization is triggered by the dreamer noticing some impossible or unlikely occurrence in the dream, such as flying or meeting the deceased. Sometimes people become lucid without noticing any particular clue in the dream; they just suddenly realize they are in a dream. A minority of lucid dreams (according to the research of LaBerge and colleagues, about 10 percent) are the result of returning to REM (dreaming) sleep directly from an awakening with unbroken reflective consciousness.\n\nThe basic definition of lucid dreaming requires nothing more than becoming aware that you are dreaming. However, the quality of lucidity can vary greatly. When lucidity is at a high level, you are aware that everything experienced in the dream is occurring in your mind, that there is no real danger, and that you are asleep in bed and will awaken shortly. With low-level lucidity you may be aware to a certain extent that you are dreaming, perhaps enough to fly or alter what you are doing, but not enough to realize that the people are dream representations, or that you can suffer no physical damage, or that you are actually in bed."

Check around for that in your area. Also, call as many dentisits as you can today/tomorrow and ask to be put on a cancellation list. If you have a regular general dentist that you've been to before and recently he will probably call in some antibiotics for you now. \nAnytime you have a toothache, keep your head elevated above your heart, which just means don't lay flat. Clove oil may also help, as pointed out above. If all else fails, take 800 mg. of Motrin every 6-8 hrs. and try to hang in there. Good luck."

2,"I would stick to body weight workout routines. You could also add some resistance, just by purchasing exercise bands.\n\nSession 1\n\nThis session centers on the chest, back, arms, and trapezius muscles. Here are the exercises:\n\n    * Toe touch (calisthenic warmup)\n    * Push ups (use pushup bars -- chest)\n      For extra work and variety: raise feet to same height as bars.\n    * Horizontal pullups (use a broomstick across to chairs -- upper back)\n    * Dips (hands on two chairs -- tricepts)\n    * Curl ups (pullups with palms facing inward -- biceps)\n    * Good Morning / Deadlift (dumbells -- low back and hamstrings)\n      Be sure to keep your back straight or slightly arched when you bend over.\n    * Elbow Raise (dumbells -- trapezius)\n    * Shoulder shrugs (dumbells -- trapezius)\n\nSession #2\n\nThis session works the deltoids, lats, and leg muscles. Here are the exercises:\n\n    * Windmills (calisthenic warmup)\n    * Neck isometrics (forward/back, side-to-side, turning left/right)\n    * Handstand pushups (deltoids and trapezius)\n    * Standing Rotations and Raises (deltoids)\n      Arms straight ahead, circle hand counterclockwise 10 times, then clockwise 10 times. Arms to sides, do the same circling. Then lift arms straight ahead 10 times and then to sides 10 times. For extra resistance, hold very light dumbells (a pound or two).\n    * BentOver Rotations and Raises (deltoids)\n      Same as above, only bent forward from the waist.\n    * Pullups (palms out -- lats)\n    * Squats (dumbells -- quads and buttocks)\n    * Calf Raises\n    * Foot Curls\n      Imagine a towel under your foot. Work to curl it up.\n\nGrips and Hips\n\nThe sequences above work all the major muscle groups, with the exception of the forearms and hips, and inner thighs. To target those muscle groups, here are some exercises you can optionally throw in for a third day of exercising:\n\n    * Wrist Rolls\n      The best piece of equipment for this is a weight hanging from a rope attached to the center of a bar. Rotate the bar to bring the weight up, then rotate in the reverse direction to lower it. This works the inner forearm on the concentric (raising) movement and the outer forearm on the eccentric (lowering) movement. After the weight is lowered, continue rotating in the same direction to work the outer forearm on the concentric movement and the inner forearm on the eccentric. {If you can't find or make that piece of equipment, use a dumbell to do wrist curls. Sit, resting your arm on your leg, and curl a dumbell with your wrist, palm up. Use a slightly lower weight to do the curls palm down.)\n    * Hammer Curls\n      Hold a heavy bar at one end, with the long part behind you. Rotate the wrist down using the same motion you use for a hammer so that the far end of the bar rises up behind you.\n    * Reverse Hammer Curls\n      Hold the heavy bar at one end with the long part in front of you. Raise the far end of the bar upwards using only the wrist.\n    * Wrist Rotations\n      With the bar upright, grasp the bottom end. Rotate the bar until it is parallel to the ground, first on one side, then on the other.\n    * Donut Curl\n      Squeeze one of the donut-shaped hand exercisers. If you can't find one, use one of the hand-squeeze exercisers or a tennis ball.\n    * Pelvic Thrust\n      Lie on your back, legs bent with feet flat on the ground, hips in the air. Squeeze your butt and push your hips up. Use a weight plate for extra resistance.\n    * Inner Leg Raise\n      Lie on your side, with one leg over the other. For the upper leg, put the foot flat on the floor in front of you. Lift the lower leg towards the ceiling. For extra resistance, use ankle weights.\n    * Outer Leg Raise\n      Lie on your side and lift your upper leg towards the ceiling. For extra resistance, use ankle weights. For variety, do this exercise standing up."

2,"It has been generally accepted that right unilateral ECT is a clinically effective treatment that produces less impairment of new learning capacity and less amnesia for remote events than bilateral ECT. However, since right unilateral ECT is specifically associated with impairment in nonverbal memory (e.g., memory for spatial relationships, faces, designs and other material that is difficult to encode verbally, and since most studies of ECT and memory loss have employed verbal memory tests, the actual extent of memory loss associated with right unilateral ECT has remained somewhat unclear. It has been suggested that the amnesic effects of left or right unilateral ECT may be similar to the effects of left or right temporal lobe dysfunction. Accordingly, if memory were assessed with nonverbal tests specifically sensitive to right temporal lobe dysfunction, the amnesic effect of right unilateral ECT might prove to be as great as or even greater than that of bilateral ECT."

But, cancer is a complicated disease.\n\nIn order to answer your question it would help to know what type of cancer your friend has, what stage the cancer was in (one tumor in one area or multiple tumors within the body) the rate of tumor growth (aggressive or slow growing), and the grade of the tumor (low means almost normal, high grade means very abnormal looking cells)\n\nOutcome of surgery and overall prognosis depends upon your friends general health, age,  and ability to undergo further treatment. It is not enough in most cases to just remove the cancer. Cancer has the ability to metastasize or spread out tiny, microscopic cells throughout the body. \n\nDepending upon the stage and grade of the tumor will determine what type of treatment that will be offered.\n\nIf the doctor was unable to resect the entire tumor and some tissue was left behind further treatment is necessary. This leftover cancer has the ability to metastasize. In order to prevent this an oncologist will recommend chemotherapy or radiation or both to try and kill off any remaining cancer cells.\n\nYour friend may also have secondary health issues that have become complicated by having cancer too.

This law states that all children with disabilities between ages of 6 and 21, regardless of the type or severity of their disability are to receive free, appropriate public education at the public's expense.  It means that the schools are required by law to make accomendations (differently worded tests, longer testing periods, different testing environment, etc) and provide you with services (allowing you to tape record lectures, have a note taker, etc).\n\nI'm pretty sure though that once you get past 21, the government is not going to give you money or assistance, but you can't be discriminated against as far as jobs go and great bosses will understand your condition and try to make accomendations for you.\n\nHope this helps!"

2,"Many people infected with syphilis do not have any symptoms for years, yet remain at risk for late complications if they are not treated. Although transmission appears to occur from persons with sores who are in the primary or secondary stage, many of these sores are unrecognized. Thus, most transmission is from persons who are unaware of their infection.\n\nPrimary Stage\nThe primary stage of syphilis is usually marked by the appearance of a single sore (called a chancre), but there may be multiple sores. The time between infection with syphilis and the start of the first symptom can range from 10 to 90 days (average 21 days). The chancre is usually firm, round, small, and painless. It appears at the spot where syphilis entered the body. The chancre lasts 3 to 6 weeks, and it heals without treatment. However, if adequate treatment is not administered, the infection progresses to the secondary stage.\n\nSecondary Stage\nSkin rash and mucous membrane lesions characterize the secondary stage. This stage typically starts with the development of a rash on one or more areas of the body. The rash usually does not cause itching. Rashes associated with secondary syphilis can appear as the chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre has healed. The characteristic rash of secondary syphilis may appear as rough, red, or reddish brown spots both on the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. However, rashes with a different appearance may occur on other parts of the body, sometimes resembling rashes caused by other diseases. Sometimes rashes associated with secondary syphilis are so faint that they are not noticed. In addition to rashes, symptoms of secondary syphilis may include fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, patchy hair loss, headaches, weight loss, muscle aches, and fatigue. The signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis will resolve with or without treatment, but without treatment, the infection will progress to the latent and late stages of disease.\n\nLate Stage\nThe latent (hidden) stage of syphilis begins when secondary symptoms disappear. Without treatment, the infected person will continue to have syphilis even though there are no signs or symptoms; infection remains in the body. In the late stages of syphilis, it may subsequently damage the internal organs, including the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints. This internal damage may show up many years later. Signs and symptoms of the late stage of syphilis include difficulty coordinating muscle movements, paralysis, numbness, gradual blindness, and dementia. This damage may be serious enough to cause death."

These contents, usually portions of intestine or abdominal fatty tissue, are often enclosed in the thin membrane that naturally lines the inside of the cavity. Although the term hernia can be used for bulges in other areas, it most often is used to describe hernias of the lower torso (abdominal wall hernias).\n\nHernias by themselves usually are harmless, but nearly all have a potential risk of having their blood supply cut off (becoming strangulated). If the hernia sac contents have their blood supply cut off at the hernia opening in the abdominal wall, it becomes a medical and surgical emergency."

When you ""sleep like a baby"" you are sleeping very nicely and not waking up or tossing and turning, basically not worrying about anything.  I guess it depends on how you interpret the quote."
2,"In a series of experiments in 1665, Richard Lower attempted to transfusion blood from one dog to another. Baring the vein of one test animal and the artery of another, he would stitch them to opposite ends of a reed so blood could flow from one animal into another.\n\n? A record of this experiment is contained in the diary of Samuel Pepys.\n\nJean Baptiste Denis, was a physician to Louis XIV At precisely 6 in the evening on December 19th, an associate opened a vein in Mauroys's arm, inserted a silver tube and drained off about 10 ounces of blood. He then inserted the other end of the tube into the leg artery of the calf and allowed about a cupful of the calf's blood to flow into the man. The doctor hoped he calf's blood ""by its mildness and freshness might possibly allay the heat and ebullition of the patients blood"".\n\nLaboring over the patient, Denis watched for signs that the transfusion had taken effect. Minutes passed as the calf's blood flowed through the tube.  Tow hours later, the patient awoke. His pain had gone and he ate a hearty support an amused himself in whistling and a song.\n\nTwo days later, Denis gave him another transfusion even larger than the first. As soon as the blood began to enter his veins, Mauroy complained about the same feeling of heat travelling up his arm.\n \nOn December 22 1818, James Blundell gave what is recognissed as the first transfusion between humans - he injected 12 - 15 ounces of blood taken from several assistants into a patient who was dying of internal bleeding. The man rallied for two and a half hours before expiring. Next Blundell and a colleague injected six ounces of blood into a woman who was bleeding to death after a placental haemorrhage whilst giving birth. The fresh blood had no resuscitative effects. He gave two more transfusion without apparent benefit, making four failures in a row. Finally, Blundell and a colleague injected 6 ounces of blood into a woman who was bleeding to death after a uterine haemorrhage. ""I feel as strong as a bull"" she told them and recovered. Altogether Blundell transfused 10 patients over and 11 year period, five of whom survived.\n\n\nRegarding your early transfusion - impossible that  it had any effet on our current platelet count."

2,The amount of urine we make is dependent upon the amount of water and salts in our body.\nThe relative amount of salts and water in our body must be regulated and kept steady.\nOur kidneys adjust the amount of salt and water in our body.\nToo much salt or not enough water makes us feel thirsty and we drink.\nToo much water for the amount of salt inside us and our kidneys dump the water into urine.\nThe most variable process affecting the salt/water balance (apart from eating and drinking) is sweating. If we lose a lot of water as we sweat a lot during hot weather then there is less water put into urine. When it is cold we don't sweat much so the extra water is lost in urine.\n\nThe habit of eating salted crisps and peanuts developed from a marketing idea in pubs. Provide free crisp and peanuts on the bar and customers eat lots of salt. This makes us feel thirsty so we buy more drinks.

2,"It depends on the type of diabetes.\n\nThere are cases of pregnant women that only get diabetes when pregnant, gestational diabetes, which only affects her during her pregnancy. Any surgery wounds should heal normally but there is a chance of developing Type 2 diabetes afterward.\n\nIf the mother already has diabetes, the wound will still heal but it will take a great deal longer.\n\nA small cut on a non-diabetic person of about 2 inches in length, 1/2 inch in depth heals within 2-3 days; a similar cut on a diabetic will take between 3 and 5 times longer.

2,"Absolutely!\nIf you are still quite young (under 20, lets say)  chances are your period is quite irregular anyway.  Even so, at 34 yrs when I'm not on the pill, mine is not clockwork.\n   The fact is that you can get pregnant even before your first period (because you ovulate approx 2 weeks BEFORE your period)\n   Also, someone mentioned that you can have a period while being pregnant, that is not entirely true, technically.  In fact, women do experience light bleeding or ""spotting"" while pregnant, sometimes even for a few days at a time, but not a real period.\n   Back to irregularity:\n   There is a possibility that your irregularity is not normal however.  If you are menstruating, then you should be having regular checkups and pap tests.  You should ask your doctor if you have any worries about your irregularities."

2,"I have it and was diagnosed at age 26.  I got depressed and the bottom dropped out fro under me at 18 and I went for years being only diagnosed with depression.  I never attempted suicide but contemplated it for about 6 years every single day.  There were, however, manic days, where by all appearances I seemed happy to others.  I was ecstatically happy to the point that people had to make me calm down.  But when alone, the depression would immediately return with a vengeance when considered relative to the manic highs.  At one point, prior to my diagnosis, I became so consumed with my own political / religious philosophy that I went for several months in a highly delusional state until the point of psychotic hallucinations after several sleepless nights.  I was hospitalized for the first time after that and they still didn't diagnose it.  Of course I was scared and didn't tell them about the hallucinations, because I feared they'd think I was crazy. They instead treated me for alcoholism - I didn't even drink.  Finally, a couple of years after I got married, I became fascinated with a political idea that I had and began to put it to paper.  After weeks of writing incessantly and causing domestic disturbances, I went to the doctor with my notebook with me and told him that I could not stop writing - I couldn't relax and give it arrest.  At that point he diagnosed me as bipolar and I have been taking lithium and effexor every since, with limited levels of success from time to time.  There are still those moments when I'm capable of making an ass of myself with wild ideas and my enthusiasm for them.  I do not take anti-psychotic medications though as they seem to ""labotomize"" me and stop my thinking process cold.  I can't deal with that.  I am still highly intensive when it comes to religious or political debate.  Those are my two primary areas of obsessive compulsive thought.  I simply am not able to not think of these things when I ""relax"".  I can however control the pace with sedatives.  A regular sleeping schedule also helps.  \nWhen I am at my lowest low, sometimes I consider electroconvulsive therapy, but have not yet done it.  It is a bit frightening.\nGood luck, I do hope you find yourself not to have it.  But if so, there are ways to cope and control it to some degree, but I don't believe it can be totally controlled."

2,"welllll, i don't specialize in neck or head aches per se, tho' they can both certainly be caused by tooth ache...\n\nHere's the deal - The dentist removed the nerve of the tooth, so IT doesn't hurt anymore, however, prior to doing so, it's possible the dead infected nerve may have caused an abcess at the base of the root.  The swelling and infection therein (think expanding object in contricted space) is what MAY have initially caused the other pain and aches.    That infection will resolve subsequent to the removal of its source, but you could certainly still have soreness.\n\nI'd personally recommend 400-600mg of ibuprofen every 4-6 hrs.\n\ngood luck!"
2,"Never put anything on a burn except cold water.  Baking soda, ice etc all trap the heat in more and can make the burn worse.  Run it under cold water for 15 min. If it starts to blister, try not to pop it, as it will allow for infection to get in.  If the blister does open, you may want to put some antibiotic cream on it with a bandaid.  God Bless"

2,"It sounds as though you are still active.  Some considerations to make regarding your acitivity include lessening your impact with your physical fitness...changing to biking and swimming  as opposed to running or jogging...eating a well-balanced diet that included plenty of water and avoids caffiene and alcholol (dehydrates your body).  When you find that even with these modifications that your acitivty is still limited, then it is a good time to consider joint replacement.  \n\nJoint replacements continue to improve in technology and technique and I imagine they will only continue to improve.  Some surgeons now perform the minimally invasive technique which only requires about a 4 to 6 inch scar and usually only requires an overnight hospital stay.  Pain and recovery time is lessened with this technique, but not all candidates qualify for this approach.  \n\nIf you are at the point where you cannot carry on your normal acitivities and are having a cosultation for a hip replacement, don't let anyone tell you that you are ""too young""...yes, you will probably need a revision(s) in the future...but better to do it when you are younger rather than put it off another 20 years until you are so disabled that you've lost all your strength, cannot exercise, have developed a heart condition, have become obese due to lack of exercise, etc.  \n\nThere are people your age who undergo hip replacement, but it is rare.  When it limits your acitivities even with the modifications listed above, that's the time to consider it...otherwise, let the technology continue to progress!"

2,I don't think they've been doing them long enough to know. Technically there might not be too many issues considering the types of surgery around now. I think the biggest issue is the psychological impact on the patient - I am sure many people would not be able to cope as our appearence is so intrinsic as to who we are. Also I think it unlikely there will be many donors and it will be very difficult for the bereaved to come to terms with the possibility of a loved-ones face being used by someone else.
2,"The high blood pressure associated with true black licorice is liked to a chemical called glycyrrhizin, which comes from the licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra).  Once in the body and transformed into glycyrrhizic acid, this chemical inhibits the enzyme (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) that converts cortisol to cortisone.  Cortisol can bind to the same receptors that aldosterone can (they are both steroid hormones).  So ultimately, the intake of glycyrrhizin leads to the body believing it has a higher level of aldosterone in the body.  This subsequently leads to water and sodium retention, higher blood volume, and therefore, higher blood pressure.\n\nAccording to Hershey's webiste, Twizzlers (a product of Hershey's) is actually made to taste like black licorice, but does not contain either glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhizic acid.  Now, it may contain other ingredients that can still increase blood pressure (sugar in general can increase blood pressure but usually by smaller amounts) but it will not fake out the body that aldosterone levels are high.  The only sure-fire way to know if true licorice extract (and therefore glycyrrhizin) is inside the candy is to read the label or contact the manufacturer.  If it's made with licorice extract or ""made from licorice root"", stay away (if you have high blood pressure).   Otherwise, enjoy!"

But as the disease gets worse, many people have decreased urine output. As a result, fluid builds up in the body tissues and organs. Here are some common symptoms of acute renal failure: \nirregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias \nexcess fluid in the abdomen, called ascites \ncognitive impairments, which include an altered mental status \ncoma \npalpitations, which are unusual sensations of the heart beating rapidly in the chest \nshortness of breath \nedema, which means swelling of the extremities \nDiuretic medicines, known as water pills, are sometimes used to help the kidneys get rid of fluid in the body. In other situations, fluids are given to promote increased blood flow to the kidneys. If blood loss or shock has occurred, blood transfusions ay be given. Salt imbalances are monitored closely. Medicines can be given to lower elevated electrolytes levels. Dialysis may be used to replace kidney function until the acute renal failure resolves. Dialysis is a procedure where the blood flow from a person is redirected through a special machine. The machine filters the blood and then returns it to the person."

2,"A cyst is a closed sac- or bladder-like structure that is not a normal part of the tissue where it is found. Cysts are common and can occur anywhere in the body in persons of any age. Cysts usually contain a gaseous, liquid, or semisolid substance. Cysts vary in size; they may be detectable only under a microscope or they can grow so large that they displace normal organs and tissues. The outer wall of a cyst is called the capsuleCysts can arise through a variety of processes in the body, including: \n\n""Wear and tear"" or simple obstructions to the flow of fluid \nInfections \nTumors \nChronic inflammatory conditions \nGenetic (inherited) conditions \nDefects in developing organs in the embryo \nThe majority of cysts are benign, but some may produce symptoms due to their size and/or location. Rarely, cysts can be associated with malignant tumors (cancers) or serious infections. If you're concerned about any abnormal swelling or ""lump,"" talk to your doctor. He or she can recommend appropriate diagnostic tests to determine the cause of the cyst.Polycystic ovarian disease (PCO), also known by the name Stein-Leventhal syndrome, is a hormonal problem that causes women to have a variety of symptoms including:\n\nIrregular or no periods \nAcne \nObesity, and \nExcess hair growth. \nAny of the above symptoms and signs may be absent with the exception of irregular or no periods. All women with PCO will have irregular or no menses. Women who have PCO do not regularly ovulate; that is, they do not release an egg every month. This is why they do not have regular periods. No one is quite sure what causes PCO. However, the ovaries of women with PCO frequently contain a number of small cysts, hence the name poly (many) cystic ovarian disease. A similar number of cysts may occur in women without PCO. Therefore, the cysts themselves do not seem to be the cause of the problem. A malfunction of the body's blood sugar control system (insulin system) is frequent in women with PCO. The result is an inadequate response to insulin (insulin resistance) that can lead to abnormally elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels. The insuliin disturbance is thought to also be the trigger for the development of symptoms such as acne and excess hair growth that is seen with PCO."

2,"Hi, I have celiac disease (wheat/gluten allergy) and am allergic to soy. I use Bette Hagmans Cookbooks because although everything is pretty much just gluten free she tells you how to use the recipes by substituting safe ingredients for your child in place of the eggs, and soy. The nuts in all her recipes are optional and she teaches you how to use egg replacer in her recipes. She has many cookbooks out...I have about four and there are still more out there. And her recipes are easy, even for me and I am just starting to learn to cook all these different ways too. Amazon.com is the easiest way to find all her books in one place. Also, a good website is glutensolutions.com, they sell pre-made food and you can check off you son's allergies and it will show you the products that  are safe for him to eat. Also all the ingredients for each item are listed so you can double check for everything as well. Hope this helps!"

2,"In general, gleeking occurs when excessive saliva accumulates in the mouth (due to stimulation of the sublingual gland) and is propelled out as a stream or mist through the narrow gap between the maxillary central incisors. This may occur accidentally (e.g. while talking, eating, or yawning) but may also be the result of deliberately forcing the saliva out via a subtle action involving strategic interplay between the tongue and lower jaw. This action is a learned skill; like ear wiggling, not everyone can do it. One popular method is to press the underside of the tongue against the palate, then push the tongue forward while pulling the lower jaw slightly backward. Another method is to yawn deeply, and then press the tongue against the palate. This method is usually more successful, but is also more obvious."

2,"A CEA test is ordered when the patient’s symptoms suggest the possibility of cancer. The CEA level is also tested before treatment in cancer patients, especially patients with GI cancers. CEA levels are monitored during therapy. It is also used to follow up patients after therapy.\nCEA is most useful to monitor treatment of cancer patients. It is used with patients who have had surgery to measure response to therapy and to monitor whether the disease is recurring. A blood test for CEA is often used as a tumor marker. Physicians can use CEA results to determine the stage and extent of disease, and the outlook in patients with cancer, especially gastrointestinal (GI) and, in particular, colorectal cancer. CEA is also used as a marker for other forms of cancer. It has been found helpful in monitoring patients with cancer of the rectum, lung, breast, liver, pancreas, stomach, and ovary. Not all cancers produce CEA, therefore the CEA test is not used for screening the general population.\n\nOn initial testing, patients with smaller and early-stage tumors are likely to have low, if not normal, CEA levels, while patients with more advanced tumors, or tumors that have spread throughout the body, are likely to have initially high CEA levels. When CEA levels decrease to “normal” levels after therapy, it means that the CEA-producing tumor has been removed. A steadily rising CEA level is occasionally the first sign of tumor recurrence. When cancer spreads to other organs, CEA levels rise and may be present in other types of bodily fluids besides blood. For example, if CEA is detected in cerebrospinal fluid, this indicates a central nervous system metastasis."

2,"YES, get a second opinion!!!  It's unusual for an adult to have an umbilical hernia.  A hernia is a tear in the muscle and the protrusion is his intestine coming through the tear.  In children, this will naturally heal as they grow (most of the time).  In adults, it will probably need a repair which is no big deal.  However, it can get larger and that intestine can become ""strangled"" and lose circulation.  Then you have severe problems. See a surgeon.  God Bless."

2,"Some info about vitiligo...\nWhat Is Vitiligo?\n\nVitiligo (vit-ill-EYE-go) is a disorder in which white patches of skin appear on different parts of the body. This happens because the cells that make pigment (color) in the skin are destroyed. These cells are called melanocytes (ma-LAN-o-sites). Vitiligo can also affect the mucous membranes (such as the tissue inside the mouth and nose) and the eye.\n\nWhat Causes Vitiligo?\n\nThe cause is not known. Vitiligo may be an autoimmune disease. These diseases happen when your immune system mistakenly attacks some part of your own body. In vitiligo, the immune system may destroy the melanocytes in the skin. It is also possible that one or more genes may make a person more likely to get the disorder.\n\nSome researchers think that the melanocytes destroy themselves. Others think that a single event such as sunburn or emotional distress can cause vitiligo. But these events have not been proven to cause vitiligo.\n\nWho Is Affected by Vitiligo?\n\nIn the United States, 2 to 5 million people have the disorder. Most people with vitiligo develop it before their 40th birthday. The disorder affects all races and both sexes equally.\n\nPeople with certain autoimmune diseases (such as thyroid disease) are more likely to get vitiligo than people who don't have any autoimmune diseases. Scientists do not know why vitiligo is connected with these diseases. However, most people with vitiligo have no other autoimmune disease.\n\nVitiligo may also run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. However, most children will not get vitiligo even if a parent has it.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Vitiligo?\n\nWhite patches on the skin are the main sign of vitiligo. These patches are more common in areas where the skin is exposed to the sun. The patches may be on the hands, feet, arms, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches are:\n\nThe armpits and groin (where the leg meets the body) \nAround the mouth \nEyes \nNostrils \nNavel \nGenitals. \nPeople with vitiligo often have hair that turns gray early. Those with dark skin may notice a loss of color inside their mouths.\n\nWill the White Patches Spread?\n\nThere is no way to tell if vitiligo will spread. For some people, the white patches do not spread. But often the white patches will spread to other areas of the body. For some people, vitiligo spreads slowly, over many years. For other people, spreading occurs quickly. Some people have reported more white patches after physical or emotional stress.\n\nHow Is Vitiligo Diagnosed?\n\nThe doctor will use a family and medical history, physical exam, and tests to diagnose vitiligo. The doctor may ask questions such as:\n\nDo you have family members with vitiligo? \nDo you or family members have any autoimmune diseases? \nDid you have a rash, sunburn, or other skin problem before the white patches appeared? \nDid you have some type of stress or physical illness? \nDid your hair turn gray before age 35? \nAre you sensitive to the sun? \nThe doctor will do a physical exam to rule out other medical problems.\n\nTests might include:\n\nTaking a small sample (biopsy) of the affected skin to be examined \nBlood tests \nAn eye exam. \n\n\nHow Is Vitiligo Treated?\n\nTreatment may help make the skin look better. The choice of treatment depends on:\n\nThe number of white patche \nHow widespread the patches are \nThe treatment the person prefers to use. \nSome treatments are not right for everyone. Many treatments can have unwanted side effects. Treatments can take a long time, and sometimes they don't work.\n\nCurrent treatment options for vitiligo include medical, surgical, and other treatments. Most treatments are aimed at restoring color to the white patches of skin.\n\nMedical treatments include:\n\nMedicines (such as steroid creams) that you put on the skin \nMedicines that you take by mouth \nA treatment that uses medicine plus ultraviolet A (UVA) l"

2,"I use the newer FreeStyle Flash meter. It's very small and easy to take with you wherever you go, but the best reason I can give you for using it is alternate site testing. I test on my forearm, but there are several other areas you can use with testing (heel of hand, inside of thigh, etc.). If you have never tried testing anywhere except your fingers, you will love the difference. \n\nThe only downfall to this meter is the cost of the strips, but hopefully you have an insurance plan that will help with this. \n\nGood luck and best wishes...."
2,"Your seven year may just be making a healthy choice that will keep him healthy in years to come. I worked as a cook at an elementary school for 9 years. I'm now a deli manager. Nutrition is something I know lol\n\nYou are right about the beans. They have lots of protein in them. Here are some suggestions to take in consideration. \n\nSee to it that he gets lots of fruits and veggies. There are some fun tasty single serve applesauce cups that you can get at the grocery store that serves at one fruit serving. Also salsa is a fun way to get a veggie serving. A fourth cup of it is a veggie serving. Peanuts and peanutbutter is great source of protein. Two tablespoons of pb on bread with a school size carton of milk is a balanced meal. There are also many protein drinks and bars out that are really good. PayDay has a protein bar out that is awesome!! It is so tasty and it has 15 grams of protein. That's about 6 grams less that my boyfriends protein bars he eats when working out. Also, there are several tasty cereal on the shelf these days that are high in protein. \n\nI hope I helped. It's really not a big deal as long as he likes other healthy foods :)"
2,"What are canker sores?\nCanker sores are shallow, painful sores in your mouth. They are usually red or may sometimes have a white coating over them. You might get them on the inside of your lips, the insides of your cheeks, the base of your gums or under your tongue. Canker sores are different from fever blisters, which usually are on the outside of your lips or the corners of your mouth.\n\nAnyone can get canker sores, but women people in their teens and 20s get them more often. Canker sores may run in families, but they aren't contagious. Doctors don't know what causes canker sores, but they may be triggered by stress, poor nutrition, food allergies and menstrual periods.\n\nWhat should I do when I get canker sores? \nCanker sores usually go away without any treatment. For pain relief, you can try taking ibuprofen (brand name: Advil) or acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol). Other medicines, such as Anbesol, Oragel, Orabase and Zilactin-B, might keep your canker sores from becoming irritated by eating, drinking or brushing your teeth. You put these medicines right on the sore.\n\nYou can also mix equal amounts of Milk of Magnesia and Benadryl Allergy liquid. After it's mixed, you can swish a teaspoonful in your mouth for about 1 minute and then spit it out. If you do this every 4 to 6 hours, your canker sores may hurt less.\n\nSome people think that sucking on zinc lozenges, taking vitamin C or vitamin B complex, using a sage-and-chamomile mouthwash or taking a lysine supplement helps their canker sores heal faster.\n\nWhat can I do to prevent canker sores?\nUnfortunately, doctors don't know of anything that prevents canker sores from forming. However, using a toothpaste that does not contain SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and other irritating ingredients (one brand name: Squigle), avoiding hard, crunchy or spicy foods and chewing gum may help reduce mouth irritation. Brushing your teeth after meals, using a soft toothbrush and flossing every day will also keep your mouth free of food that might cause a canker sore. If you get canker sores often, or if they're very painful, talk to your family doctor."
2,"ADD/ADHD is not an imaginary disorder.  It is a chronic developmental disorder which is genetically based.  It is not a learning disability, but can co?exist with learning disabilities in approximately 25 to 33 percent of those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD.\n\nI am taking concerta.  It is fine for this problem.  There are side effects however.\n\nI never heard of anyone who is taking or is told to take two different kinds of this medication together.  I am not positive but I don't think it is a good idea."
2,Yes I believe they make a difference.  My doctor said my iron storage was low and suggested I take a multi vitamin.  (I was feeling draggy for a long time before this.)  I noticed a difference in my energy level after about a week of vitamins.  Also I found Calcium/Magnesium pills work for women suffering from PMS.
2,"As a mammographer, I am not a fan of breast implants. As we know, early detection of breast cancer DOES save lives. It is very hard to find an early breast cancer on mammography, even with improved techniques. The implant hides the breast tissue on the film. Please research this aspect of it. If you still decide to have implants, have them put in BEHIND the chest wall. That will allow a bit more breast tissue to be imaged during mammography. Good luck to you and please do your homework!\n\nHere are what some ""experts"" say. You can go to the links for additional info:\n\nBreast implant interference with imaging breast tissue, with between 22% and 83% of mammographically visualizable breast tissue obscured by breast implants. http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastimplants/b-adverse-events.html\nIn women without implants, mammography detected 67% of cancers. In women with implants, mammography detected 45% of cancers. \nhttp://www.breastcancer.org/breast_implant_mammogram.html\nScreening mammography missed 55% of breast cancers in women with implants, compared with only 33% among women without implants. \nhttp://www.menagainstbreastcancer.org/online_support/resources/mammography_and_breast_implants.php\n\nFor even more info: \nhttp://www.menagainstbreastcancer.org/online_support/resources/mammography_and_breast_implants.php\nhttp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mammography/mmwebbro/mambrochure.html\n\nI have also “handled” probably over 2,000 breasts with implants.

2,"Do you remember what exactly happened to trigger this fear?  Was it a bad experience?  Just keep in mind that when you are speaking publicly, nobody expects perfection.  The occasional ""uh"" and 'um"" is overlooked.  And if you make a mistake, like drop your notes or say the wrong word, have a laugh about it.  The audience appreciates little mix-ups like that because they can chuckle and feel comfortable.  What really impresses a listener is a speaker who speaks from the heart---not somebody who sounds like they're regurgitating some perfectly written speech.\nReally, it's just something that takes practice and most people are sympathetic.  I remember hearing that public speaking is the biggest phobia...most people fear it more than death!"

2,"I leave you to make you're own judgment from the following quotes from Wiki, both from good verifiable sources and not the pen of a marketing company trying to make a buck from a mug.\n\nQuote 1:\nPfizer released the rights to the primary ingredient in 2002. Paul \nHutson, associate professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Pharmacy, told the Wisconsin State News, ""For Pfizer to release something dealing with obesity suggests to me that they felt there was no merit to its oral use""\n\nIn other words, it doesn't work as it would have been a goldmine to Pfizer if it had.\n\nQuote 2:\nIn March 2006, Consumer Reports investigated the dietary supplement and concluded, ""This weight loss drug lacks the clinical evidence for the Consumer Reports experts to recommend this product.""\n\nIn other words, there is no scientifically verifiable evidence showing it is effective. Anecdotal quotes by pleased clients preferred by marketeers don't cut much scientific mustard!\n\nSo, I suspect the side effects are that you'll be wasting your money. If you want to lose weight there are only two known methods which don't involve surgery- take in less calories by eating less or eating better and increase calorie usage by doing more exercise either directly in exercise classes or indirectly by lifestyle changes- walk, cycle to work instead of using the car, etc."

2,"good question.  my mom had chronic diarreah for years, sprinkled with occasional constipation.  it was terrible to live with even for the family. every time we started to go somewhere she ended up in the bathroom, and many times had to forgo the destination.  We thought it was related to severe food allergies.  Well years later after she mellowed out, after several tests, doctors, and near surgry. the episodes ceased.  she does have some food allergies and now only has very occasional dirreah.  The  determined cause.....stress, and anxiety.  Once she managed to learn to deal with life better she began to digest better.  guess what when i got about 22 years old the same thing happend to me.  now that i am on meds and in therapy, my bowels are more controlled. but i have noticed that stress, and life events bring on a bout of bowel trouble, usually dirreah.  my advice....seek mental health care...and chill out."

3,"biochemistry, science concerned chiefly with the chemistry of biological processes; it attempts to utilize the tools and concepts of chemistry, particularly organic and physical chemistry, for elucidation of the living system. The science has been variously referred to as physiological chemistry and as biological chemistry. Molecular biology, a term first used in 1950, is used to describe the area of research, closely related to and often overlapping biochemistry, conducted by biologists whose approach to and interest in biology are principally at the molecular level of organization. The related field of biophysics brings to biology the techniques and attitudes of the physicist. Cell biology is concerned with the organization and functioning of the individual cell and depends greatly on biochemical techniques. As the study of life forms demonstrated similar or even identical processes occurring in widely divergent species, it has taken the biochemist to unravel the underlying chemical basis for these phenomena. Biochemists study such things as the structures and physical properties of biological molecules, including the proteins, the carbohydrates, the lipids, and the nucleic acids; the mechanisms of enzyme action; the chemical regulation of metabolism; the molecular basis of genetic expression; the chemistry of vitamins; chemoluminescence; biological oxidation; and energy utilization in the cell. The study of the chemistry of the immune response offers the possibility of treatment and cure for such diseases as AIDS and lupus."

3,"The Great Depression was an economic slump in North America, Europe, and other industrialized areas of the world that began in 1929 and lasted until about 1939. It was the longest and most severe depression ever experienced by the industrialized Western world.\n\nThough the U.S. economy had gone into depression six months earlier, the Great Depression may be said to have begun with a catastrophic collapse of stock-market prices on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1929. During the next three years stock prices in the United States continued to fall, until by late 1932 they had dropped to only about 20 percent of their value in 1929. Besides ruining many thousands of individual investors, this precipitous decline in the value of assets greatly strained banks and other financial institutions, particularly those holding stocks in their portfolios. Many banks were consequently forced into insolvency; by 1933, 11,000 of the United States' 25,000 banks had failed. The failure of so many banks, combined with a general and nationwide loss of confidence in the economy, led to much-reduced levels of spending and demand and hence of production, thus aggravating the downward spiral. The result was drastically falling output and drastically rising unemployment; by 1932, U.S. manufacturing output had fallen to 54 percent of its 1929 level, and unemployment had risen to between 12 and 15 million workers, or 25-30 percent of the work force.\n\nThe Great Depression began in the United States but quickly turned into a worldwide economic slump owing to the special and intimate relationships that had been forged between the United States and European economies after World War I. The United States had emerged from the war as the major creditor and financier of postwar Europe, whose national economies had been greatly weakened by the war itself, by war debts, and, in the case of Germany and other defeated nations, by the need to pay war reparations. So once the American economy slumped and the flow of American investment credits to Europe dried up, prosperity tended to collapse there as well. The Depression hit hardest those nations that were most deeply indebted to the United States, i.e., Germany and Great Britain. In Germany, unemployment rose sharply beginning in late 1929, and by early 1932 it had reached 6 million workers, or 25 percent of the work force. Britain was less severely affected, but its industrial and export sectors remained seriously depressed until World War II. Many other countries had been affected by the slump by 1931.\n\nAlmost all nations sought to protect their domestic production by imposing tariffs, raising existing ones, and setting quotas on foreign imports. The effect of these restrictive measures was to greatly reduce the volume of international trade: by 1932 the total value of world trade had fallen by more than half as country after country took measures against the importation of foreign goods.\n\nThe Great Depression had important consequences in the political sphere. In the United States, economic distress led to the election of the Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt to the presidency in late 1932. Roosevelt introduced a number of major changes in the structure of the American economy, using increased government regulation and massive public-works projects to promote a recovery. But despite this active intervention, mass unemployment and economic stagnation continued, though on a somewhat reduced scale, with about 15 percent of the work force still unemployed in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. After that, unemployment dropped rapidly as American factories were flooded with orders from overseas for armaments and munitions. The depression ended completely soon after the United States' entry into World War II in 1941. In Europe, the Great Depression strengthened extremist forces and lowered the prestige of liberal democracy. In Germany, economic distress directly contributed to Adolf Hitler's ri"

3,"The first difference would be their geographical location.  Mesopotamia was located in the Tigris-Euphrates River Valley.  Greece is located along the Aegean Sea.  As a result of their locations, the Mesopotamians were primarily farmers and the Greeks were mostly fishermen and herders too.  The mountainous soil of Greece made it hard to grow crops so they couldn't establish a surplus of crops and had to rely more on fishing and herding.  While both worshiped a pantheon of gods, the gods were different in that some of the Mesopotamian gods were half human and half animal.  The Greek gods weren't.  Both were city states and the two well known of the Greeks were Athens and Sparta.  If my memory serves me correctly, Ur was one of the major city states of Mesopotamia.  The Mesopotamians wrote in symbols called Sanskrit which looks like a bunch of wedged dashes and the Greeks used a letter alphabet based on the Phoenicians alphabet.   The Greeks were more advanced scientifically, militarily and philosophically. The Greeks also were the first democracy and our system of government is based on the Greeks' ideas.   However, the Mesopotamians get credit for the first written law code-- Hammurabi's Code.   I can go on and on, but I think this touches on the main differences between the two."

3,"The 1960's music was probably the biggest Renaissance in music ever. The 60's genre generally covers the period from 1963 to 1969. The Beatles started the revolution with the release of 'Love Me Do' in October 1962. Suddenly we had a record written by the performers, which was unusual in those days, and different from anything else. Prior to that we had Rock and Roll which was mainly a collection of upbeat 12 bar songs often written and performed by black singers, Little Richard and Chuck Berry for example. A big influence was Buddy Holly who was killed in a plane crash on 3rd February 1959 (The Day the Music Died). The US government was so worried by this and the effect on teenagers, that it forced many record companies to stop producing this type of music and replace it with 'schmaltz', songs by such as Bobby Darin, Bobby Vee, Fabian and so on and the Twist craze, Chubby Checker etc. This was meant to calm US teenagers down. When the Beatles exploded so did music. Most came from England with the 'Mersey Sound', a collection of artistes and groups from Liverpool, The Beatles, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers being the main ones. Then came the Manchester Sound with Herman's Hermits, The Hollies, Freddie and the Dreamers and so on. London produced The Dave Clark Five and The Rolling Stones, Newcastle The Animals and Birmingham The Moody Blues, The Move and The Electric Light Orchestra. Add to that Cliff Richard and The Shadows, Tom Jones and Englebert Humperdinck, Dusty Springfield, Sandy Shaw, Eric Clapton and dozens of others and you had the new exciting music scene that the 60's brought. Most were self contained groups, the usual line up comprising or drums, bass guitar, lead guitar, rhythm guitar or organ/piano and a singer, unless the musicians sang. Almost overnight interest in existing artistes diminished. A few survived, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley etc and in the US The Beach Boys became the biggest act with The Four Seasons close behind but, by and large the new order took over. As the 60's progressed so did music, very rapidly. In the early part of the decade songs were relatively simple, boy meets girl, true love, me and you and so on but by 1967 The Beatles had produced Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, possibly the greatest album ever with much more complex music and which featured orchestral music, Indian instruments and even animal sounds. In 1967 we had the Summer of Love and fashions changed from Italian style suits with narrow trousers preferred by the boys and wide petticoat skirts for the girls with brightly coloured clothes and flared trousers, Girls wore tight mini skirts. Carnaby Street in London became the 60's fashion centre of the world. Naturally such good music could not last forever and soon the major record companies and money men took over and commercialism became more important. As the 70's dawned the good, raunchy and musicly excellent songs of the 60's gave way to glam rock and bubble gum music and has deteriorated ever since. Just look at the trashy drivel we have had since ... punk, rap, heavy metal. Need I go on?\n\nAs to the second part, how they got together. Well most were groups of friends with common interests in music. Most bought cheap instruments and learned how to play. Surprisingly there were some good singers amongst them and many flourished. In those days all music was 'live'. There were no pre-recorded backing tracks or tapes or miming and the musicians performed before audiences in youth clubs and coffee bars. The good ones progressed and bought better quality instruments and the best ones were picked up by the record companies. Men such as Brian Epstein, Mickey Most, Val Parnell and so on scoured England for new acts, signing up the best for their 'stables'. Almost every street had a 'group' of some sort. Many of the groups were ripped off by their agents who pocketed most o"

3,"Earthquake not earthquek.\n\nAn earthquake is a sudden and sometimes catastrophic movement of a part of the Earth's surface. Earthquakes result from the dynamic release of elastic strain energy that radiates seismic waves. Earthquakes typically result from the movement of faults, planar zones of deformation within the Earth's upper crust. The word earthquake is also widely used to indicate the source region itself. The Earth's lithosphere is a patch work of plates in slow but constant motion (see plate tectonics). Earthquakes occur where the stress resulting from the differential motion of these plates exceeds the strength of the crust. The highest stress (and possible weakest zones) are most often found at the boundaries of the tectonic plates and hence these locations are where the majority of earthquakes occur. Events located at plate boundaries are called interplate earthquakes; the less frequent events that occur in the interior of the lithospheric plates are called intraplate earthquakes (see New Madrid Seismic Zone). Earthquakes also occur in volcanic regions and as the result of a number of anthropogenic sources, such as reservoir induced seismicity, mining and the removal or injection of fluids into the crust. Seismic waves including some strong enough to be felt by humans can also be caused by explosions (chemical or nuclear), landslides, and collapse of old mine shafts, though these sources are not strictly earthquakes."

This was the usual route most traders took in reaching Asia.  Christopher Columbus believed he had reached Asia until the time he died. Later explorers were the ones who realized he had landed in a new world. The Vikings were in North America much earlier, but their main concern was food, and the only record we have of their being in North America was found in the Sagas they wrote."

3,"Daisy speaks these words in Chapter I as she describes to Nick and Jordan her hopes for her infant daughter. While not directly relevant to the novel’s main themes, this quote offers a revealing glimpse into Daisy’s character. Daisy is not a fool herself but is the product of a social environment that, to a great extent, does not value intelligence in women. The older generation values subservience and docility in females, and the younger generation values thoughtless giddiness and pleasure-seeking. Daisy’s remark is somewhat sardonic: while she refers to the social values of her era, she does not seem to challenge them. Instead, she describes her own boredom with life and seems to imply that a girl can have more fun if she is beautiful and simplistic. Daisy herself often tries to act such a part. She conforms to the social standard of American femininity in the 1920s in order to avoid such tension-filled issues as her undying love for Gatsby."
3,"These days, most English speakers dance around the traditional distinctions between ""shall"" and ""will.""\nGrammar Lady Mary Bruder says the distinction is when you're talking about what's called the simple future -- ""I shall go shopping tomorrow, that's just what I plan to do"" -- versus the more emphatic: ""I WILL go shopping tomorrow, don't try to stop me.""\nBut that's in the first person. When you're talking in the second or third person, according to tradition, you reverse them:\nSo ""You shall"" or ""they shall"" becomes a command, while ""you will"" or ""they will"" just describes the simple future. \nBut the rules are hardly simple. Maybe that's why ""shall"" is not used much anymore -- except in legal documents: ""You shall pay your taxes on time."" But lawyers argue about the level of obligation implied by ""shall"":\n\n""In favor of will, for all future tenses. And the spoken language, and the people who write on a regular basis, even in very formal language, use `will' for the future. The only common use for shall is to make suggestions: `What shall we do? Shall we go to the movies? Shall we blah blah blah. And even that is sort of the contracted `sh'll': `What sh'll we do?'""\n it's one of the questions, one of the myths of English that this is still a common distinction. The international students ask this question all the time. They think that they have to remember to use `shall' for the future sometimes and `will' at other times.""\nthis actually was a feature of English, maybe in Victorian times and the rule has remained. It's sort of like ending a sentence with a preposition or splitting an infinitive, those sorts of rules."""

3,"SYROS \n\n \nHISTORY AND CIVILIZATION\n\nSyros is the largest island of the Cyclades in terms of population, with about 20,000 inhabitants. It has a central position in the Cyclades islands, with an area of 84 square kilometers. The island has rich geography, with many hills and shallow valleys, and its coasts form a number of safe bays. Besides the densely built main town formed by Hermoupolis and Anos Syros on the East coast, there is a number of settlements scattered all over the island. In the sites of Chalandriani and Kastri, vestiges of the early Cycladic civilization (2700 BC – 2200 BC about), known as “Civilization of Syros – Keros” have been discovered. In the following centuries, the island came gradually under the influence of the Phoenicians, the Minoans, and later of the Mycenaeans. In ancient times the philosopher Ferekides, one of the forerunners of the pre-Socratic thought and also Pythagoras’ instructor, lived on the island. During the Persian wars, Syros was subjugated to the Persians and afterwards it became a member of the first Athenian alliance. The island became an autonomous state, with a parliament and municipality; however, it paid tribute to the Athenians.\n\n\n\nIn the Roman years the capital of Syros was situated in the area of contemporary Hermoupolis. At the end of ancient times, the barbaric raids and the plague of piracy, which had scourged the area of the Aegean for many centuries, led Syros to decline. In the Byzantine years Syros constituted together with the rest of the Cycladic islands, part of the Aegean Dominion. After the overthrow of the Byzantium by the Francs in 1204, Syros came under  Venetian domination and was included in the Ducat of the Aegean. Meanwhile Ano Syros was inhabited. During the Latin period, the majority of the local community accepted the Catholic Dogma, but it maintained the use of the Greek language. During the almost three and a half centuries of existence of the Ducat of the Aegean, Syros had a singular feudal regime. In the middle of the 16th century, the Ottoman fleet occupied the island and the Ducat fell apart. However the negotiations of the local authorities with the Ottoman Empire led to the offer of substantial privileges to the Cycladic islands, such as, the reduction of taxation and religious freedom. \n\nAt the same time, following an agreement between France and the Ottoman authorities, the Catholics came under the protection of the French, a privilege that was maintained for centuries. After the second half of the 17th century, a period of economic recovery of the Aegean area began, which reached its height during the transition from the 18th to the 19th century, while the special regime of the islands allowed the development of local self-government. The decline of piracy since the beginning of the 19th century had as a result the gradual liberation of the sea routes of the Eastern Mediterranean. Due to its crucial geographical position, to the support of Western powers, and to the reinforced local government, Syros became known as a maritime way-point. Moreover, the special social, religious, and institutional conditions prevailing on the island, led the Syrians to the maintenance of a neutrality at the beginning of the Greek Revolution in 1821. As a result, Syros became a secure shelter during the Revolution, and attracted many Greek refugees from Asia Minor, Chios, Psara, Kasos, and other places. The newcomers, mainly mariners and tradesmen, gave a new dynamism to the island, which, together with its demographic and economic development, was transformed into an administrative and cultural center. \n\n \n\n\n\nWith the foundation of the Greek State and the return to peace and tranquility, Syros became known as a cross-roads in the Aegean and as an international commercial center linking Western Europe and the Mediterranean sea to the East. Since 1830, the commerce of fabrics, silk, leather and iron developed in Syros, and at the same ti"

3,"Looking through the PSAT is helpful, but will only go so far, as the questions trend much more difficult on the SAT.  I have found that the best way to prepare my students for the SAT is for them to focus on how not to get tricked by the questions.  During a test, students want to finish and finish quickly, so after reading a question, they immediately read the multiple choice answers, and one stands out to them.  The problem with this is the one that stands out is not always the right answer.  I have found that the best way to eliminate this problem is for the student to cover up the answers, only read the question, answer the question, and then choose the answer.  This eliminates that problem.\n\nThe second most important tip I give my students is don't waste time on questions you know you don't know.  For example, if the question is on the circumference of a circle, and the student never studied that, then they should move on because they will gain more points by answering the latter questions correctly.\n\nFinally, I tell my students not to stress.  I have found, personally, that the biggest challenge on the SAT is stress, so find a way to eliminate that during testing.  I have seen the students who are the most relaxed, yet still prepared, do the best on the test.  I hope this helps."

3,"The process of depositing a thin film of metal on glass is centuries old.  Aluminum is now used as well as silver.  It is a little different for telescope mirrors than for mirrors used in dressing rooms and bathrooms, but basicaly:\n\n“Virtually all mirrors for interior use are manufactured by the conveyor, wet deposition method. Annealed or fully tempered glass is thoroughly cleaned by the application of cleaners and passing contact with oscillating scrub brush units. After the glass is cleaned and rinsed, the surface of the glass is sensitized with a diluted solution of tin chloride. This surface treatment allows for the deposition of silver. Silver nitrate is sprayed onto the sensitized surface of the glass along with other chemical configurations. The final outcome is the formation of a uniform silver layer on the glass.”\n\nSee the site below for additional details on the mirroring process."

3,"Environment pollution is pollution of water, air, soil, noise, light , visual and radio active .\n\n Pollution is the release of chemical, physical, biological or radioactive contaminants to the environment. Principal forms of pollution include: air , water....\nAir pollution is a broad term applied to any chemical, physical (e.g. particulate matter), or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a complex, dynamic natural system that is essential to support life on planet earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the earth's ecosystems.\n\nWorldwide air pollution is responsible for large numbers of deaths and cases of respiratory disease. Setting of air quality standards, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act, has begun to improve air quality for some pollutants. While major stationary sources are often identified with air pollution, the greatest source of emissions are actually mobile sources, principally the automobile. There are many available air pollution control technologies and urban planning strategies available to reduce air pollution; however, worldwide costs of addressing this issue are high. The most immediately available method of improving air quality is adoption of greater use of ethanol fuel (and other bio fuels) and increased reliance upon hybrid vehicle technology.\n\nYou can check out more your self.\nAir pollution :"

3,"In my opinion, ""Objective Reporting"" sounds like it means that while you report, whether it be during an interview or researching for extra information, you don't include your personal opinion in the matter. Objective means to not have your view distorted by bias, whereas subjective is more or less how you interpret things in your own eyes. I would also take into account that if you are doing an interview for a report, you would ask questions that don't show your partiality toward one topic or another; that they are relatively neutral. For further information, try looking up topics related to sociology. Sociology often dicusses how sociologists have to execute experiments and observations without weighing in their personal feelings. Good luck with your class!:)"

3,"As a nursing major myself, I have these tips for you:\n\n1. Take all of the prerequisite courses, and all of the recommended extra courses BEFORE you get into the nursing program. The more you get out of the way, the easier it will be.\n\n2. Volunteering is great, but if you want to see what it's really about, you need to get a job at the local hospital. Get your certifed Nurse aide license, and put yourself out there. That way, you'll get to know what the daily routines are, and people will see your passionate about making a career in nursing. In my instance, when I get out of nursing school, I will have a job on my unit, because people know me. It's all about networking!\n\n3. Study your buns off! People will notice, and it'll really pay off in the end.\n\n4. Pair up with another Nursing student- No one will understand like your fellow peers the pressure that's put on you to be the best nurse ever!\n\n5. A good attitude, and good PENMENSHIP go really far. Instructors will notice the extra effort that you've put in, and will be more likely to offer references for employment.\n\n6. Don't be afraid to be scared. If you weren't scared, you wouldn't be human. It's a very intimidating thing to have someone's life in your hands. Have confidence in yourself, and don't be afraid to ask stupid questions. Instructors would much rather you ask questions than to screw up.\n\nHope that helps!!!  Good luck!! Remember- NURSES CALL THE SHOTS!!!!  :)"

Here are the basics for a wire:\n\nResistance, R, of a wire is influenced by three main things: (1) the resistivity, p, of the wire, (2) the length, L, of the wire, and (3) the cross-section area, A, of the wire.  The relationship looks like this...\n\nR = (p*L)/A\n\nIncrease the resistivity or length and you increase the resistance.  Increase the cross-sectional area and you decrease the resistance.  Those are the basics anyway.  Hope this helps."

3,"That's a tough situation and I really feel for you. The most important question, is who is going to be paying? If your parents are paying, then they have only so many funds, and those funds are best used paying for in-state tuition versus paying additional tuition for you to go to Texas. \nPersonally, I think you should give Mississippi a chance, at least for the first year. See how it goes. If you really try hard, and get good grades, then maybe you can sit down with your parents when the year is over and tell them that you tried, but you really want to go back to Texas. You have to prove to your folks that you are willing to study hard and put forth an effort to at least try it where you are now. Having a great gpa after your freshman year would go a long way towards convincing them to let you change. Getting a part-time job and helping to earn some tuition money for the future wouldn't hurt either. Show them that you are dedicated and want to make your own choices. Good luck!"

Don't let acceptance into a group make or break your importance in this world.

Because that's the level at which he will function if he doesn't get at least a high school diploma, and hopefully some sort of education or training beyond that.  At 17, he's old enough to quit if he wants to, and take the consequences himself.  Don't let him live with you if he's not going to either go to school or get a job and pay rent.  Tell him if he wants to make his own decisions, make his own mistakes, that's fine with you, but you don't feel obliged to help him.  Maybe he'll get some sense into his head, and maybe it will have to be knocked in with some bad luck.  But bad luck is all he's preparing himself for!\n\nI'd soften this one way only:  if he's willing to quit and get a job, and pay rent, he should be preparing to take the GED test for a high school equivalency diploma.  It is true, after all, that some high schools are simply not worth a kid's effort.  But he has to be doing something productive, or what's the point?\n\nAnd you can tell him I said so!"
3,"Core beliefs of Buddhism:\nBuddhism, like most of the great religions of the world, is divided into a number of different traditions. However, most traditions share a common set of fundamental beliefs.\n\nOne fundamental belief of Buddhism is often referred to as reincarnation -- the concept that people are reborn after dying. In fact, most individuals go through many cycles of birth, living, death and rebirth. A practicing Buddhist differentiates between the concepts of rebirth and reincarnation. In reincarnation, the individual may recur repeatedly. In rebirth, in a person does not necessarily return to Earth as the same entity ever again. He compares it to a leaf growing on a tree. When the withering leaf falls off, a new leaf will eventually replace it. It is similar to the old leaf, but it is not identical to the original leaf.\n\nAfter many such cycles, if a person releases their attachment to desire and the self, they can attain Nirvana. This is a state of liberation and freedom from suffering. \n\n\n\nThe Three Trainings or Practices:\nThese three consist of:\n\nSila: Virtue, good conduct, morality. This is based on two fundamental principles: The principle of equality: that all living entities are equal. \n The principle of reciprocity: This is the ""Golden Rule"" in\nChristianity -- to do onto others as you would wish them do \nonto you. It is found in all major religions. \n\nSamadhi: Concentration, meditation, mental development. Developing one's mind is the path to wisdom which in turn leads to personal freedom. Mental development also strengthens and controls our mind; this helps us maintain good conduct. \nPrajna: Discernment, insight, wisdom, enlightenment. This is the real heart of Buddhism. Wisdom will emerge if your mind is pure and calm. \nThe first two paths listed in the Eightfold Path, described below, refer to discernment; the last three belong to concentration; the middle three are related to virtue. \n\n\n\nThe Four Noble Truths:\nThe Buddha's Four Noble Truths explore human suffering. They may be described (somewhat simplistically) as: \n\nDukkha: Suffering exists: (Suffering is real and and almost universal. Suffering has many causes: loss, sickness, pain, failure, the impermanence of pleasure.) \nSamudaya: There is a cause for suffering. (It is the desire to have and control things. It can take many forms: craving of sensual pleasures; the desire for fame; the desire to avoid unpleasant sensations, like fear, anger or jealousy.) \nNirodha: There is an end to suffering. (Suffering ceases with the final liberation of Nirvana (a.k.a. Nibbana). The mind experiences complete freedom, liberation and non-attachment. It lets go of any desire or craving.) \nMagga: In order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path. \n\nThe Five Precepts: \nThese are rules to live by. They are somewhat analogous to the second half of the Ten Commandments in Judaism and Christianity -- that part of the Decalogue which describes behaviors to avoid.\n\nDo not kill. This is sometimes translated as ""not harming"" or an absence of violence. \nDo not steal. This is generally interpreted as including the avoidance of fraud and economic exploitation. \nDo not lie. This is sometimes interpreted as including name calling, gossip, etc. \nDo not misuse sex. For monks and nuns, this means any departure from complete celibacy. For the laity, adultery is forbidden, along with any sexual harassment or exploitation, including that within marriage. The Buddha did not discuss consensual premarital sex within a committed relationship; Buddhist traditions differ on this. \nDo not consume alcohol or other drugs. The main concern here is that intoxicants cloud the mind. Some have included as a drug other methods of divorcing ourselves from reality -- e.g. movies, television, the Internet. 1 \n\n\nThe Eightfold Path:\nThe Buddha's Eightfold Path consists of:\n\n Panna: Discernment, wisdom: 1) Samma ditthi Righ"
3,"Let me assume the Question as: What transport systems and communication infrastructures does Bangladesh have?\n\nAnswer: The following are in order of their usage:\n\n1. Transport:\n\na) Rickshaws are primary transport mode where a tricycle is driven by man and two passengers can seat at the back passenger hold.\n\nb) 2-Stroke and 4-Stroke Scooter/Baby-Taxi: Mechanized 3-wheelers as can be seen in most of the South Asian countries. The good point is most of them has been converted into CNG from Petroil (Petrol-Oil mixed). Thereby, the pollution has reduced drastically in the main towns.\n\nC) 4-Engine Taxis (Petrol and some Diesel) Yellow-Cab and Black-Cab etc:\nThese are on-hire basis and some are air-conditioned (Yellow colored). The Fare Meter in most of these are installed and/or working or non-functional. The cabbies do a lot of haggling for fare even though the Meter-Fare is to be followed as per law.\n\nd) Mini-Bus and Bus: There are inter-city as well as local buses, both A/C and Non-A/C. The A/C buses are comfortable to ride and the fares are pre-determined.\n\ne) Railway: A system is in existence and run by the Government. Yet to come to the standard of Indian Railway in terms of Ticketing, Service and time schedule etc. The most inefficient and white-elephant we the taxpayers are living with, without any much improvement due to strong unionism.\n\nf) Air: There is a private Airline (GMG) operating feebly against another white-elephant goliath Bangladesh Biman. The schedule may change at the 11th hour due to technical, political or some higher-up coming late issues etc. (LOL).\n\ng) River: There are plenty of river transports available in this land of canals, rivers and sea. The journey is more or less comfortable during winter season (starting from November to February). The services are not at par with those of neighboring countries like India, Thailand, and Sri Lanka etc.\n\n\n2. Communication:\nIf you meant transport and communication for similar meaning then above answer may have sufficed. However, for telecommunication, the answer would be like the following:\n\nThere are plenty of Telephone, Mobile/Cell Phone, Fax, Internet, Radio/Satellite phone available if you compare Bangladesh’s progress in other fields of communication. So, once in Bangladesh you won’t miss your home country as you can keep in touch with them very easily.\n\nHope I have answered your question, if not, please send me e-mail and I will try my best to help you.\n\nBest of Luck!"
3,"Way back in February, I had done a similar report and posted it on a forum which you can find at http://desiboard.us/bb/viewtopic.php?t=36018&\n\nMay be you need to register to view it, but it sure is soething very informative and on the point.\n\nOr may be you can get in touch with me on Yahoo. Get hold of me at surajsun_92[a]yahoo.com\n\nIt begins like ....\n\nFirst of all you should understand what types of threats are there on the net...\nWhile most users are aware of virus and worms threat, they usually overlook the other biggest threat ie the spywares.\n\nWhat are spywares ?\nSpywares are programs that get installed on your computer without your knowledge and collect data about your usage patterns like what sites you visit, what programs you run, even your personal details like age, gender and financial details too : all those things that can be useful for a marketing company to send you customized advertising. These programs send this data back to their websites where they are given to spammers and advertisers. All these things happen without the user's knowledge and that is the most ironical point of the story.\n\nCategories of spywares:\n\n>> Adwares:\nAdwares usually monitors your usage patterns and show you ads corresponding to them. Adwares are usually installed as freewares and it is quoted in their EULA (End User License Agreement) that the program will show relevant ads.\nMany of the adwares are freeware version of programs which are availible as paid versions. Examples of these programs : Opera, Divx, Download Accelerator Plus, Flashget etc. While these programs specifically tells the user that they can upgrade to their paid version if they dont want to get these advertisements but not every adware is like that.\n\n>> Browser Hijackers:\nThis is a broad category in which parasites like home page hijackers and search hijackers can be included.\n    >> Home page hijackers change the start page of the user's browser to some specific sites and some notorious of these are very difficult to remove.\n    >> Search hijackers change the search behaviour of the user's browser and when user searches for something on the Internet, these search sites give them the results.\n    \nUsually both of the hijackers stated above work on clickthrough systems. Here they are affiliates to other companies which give them money according to the hits they recieve through them. So, the ultimate goal of hijackers is to make the users click on the links through which they earn their revenue. As this is a difficult task, the program authors go extreme ways to achieve it and create difficult to remove parasites. Recent examples of such parasite are CoolWebSearch and AboutBlank.\n\n>> Dialers:\nDialers are programs that promise to make some ""premium content"" availible to the users by making calls through them. All their objective is to make the users dial the number which are usually long distance numbers of their affiliates.\n\n>> Tracking Cookies:\nCookies were meant to be used for customizing the websites according to the user's preferences. But marketing companies found another use of them. This useful feature is being abused by marketing companies by putting ""third party cookies"". Third party cookies means cookies stored by websites other than you are visiting - most often put through banners and ad rotators. These cookies can keep track of what sites you visit that contains their ads........."

3,"When you say you can't get a diagnosis...\n\nHave you spoken with your doctor about getting a referral to a child psychiatrist or neuropsychologist?  A GP is not fully qualified to diagnose this stuff.\n\nIs he getting into trouble at school, and has this been happening for more than 6 months (it MUST have been happening for more than 6 months)?  Then you can get a diagnostic evaluation by a school psychologist. Ask that your son's teacher put in the paperwork. Make the request in writing, one copy to your teacher and one to the principal.\n\nIf it has been less than 6 months...\n\nKids often go through moody periods. My concern is that you say he doesn't remember afterward (although that could just be him trying to avoid consequences), and that you mentioned he appears extremely afraid of things.\n\nYou really do need to get a psychiatric/psychology expert...get that referral from your doctor."

3,"Regardless of WHAT you get on your SAT, your life is neither over nor extended. It's great to get a high score, but it isn't the end of the world if you don't. Going into any exam, never mind an SAT exam, with an attitude like yours is an invitation to test anxiety. And that almost guarantees that you will screw up on the test. \nFor a SAT to have any value at all, it should reflect your own achievement level and ability level. Do the prep, and then relax. Do the best you can and don't let your creative, analytic and constructive energies be sidetracked by something as useless as worrying about the results before you've written the test. \nGood luck!"
3,"The United States purchased the Alaskan territory from Russia in 1867 - the leading proponent of the plan was Secretary of State William Seward. The US paid what was then $7.2 million for the land - in today's dollars, that would be equivalent to a purchase price of $1.67 billion.\n\nMany mocked the purchase, wondering what the US would do with a barren, mostly frozen territory. The purchase was known as Seward's Folly and President Johnson's Icebox.\n\nThe joke was on the critics - gold was discovered in the Alaskan territory shortly after it was first found in the Klondike region of Canada in 1896.\n\nModern day Alaskans celebrate Seward's Day on the last Monday in March - a celebration of the man who inspired the purchase of the land that would one day become the 49th U.S. state"

3,"I know for a fact that no matter how I was doing in the math class, I would waste my time here. I am an expert procrastinator who always seems to pull through at the last moment, so why waste time studying when I know I'll somehow pull it off anyway? And if it was a math class, I would invariably be doing bad anyway, so I would have even less motivation to study. I'd rather waste my time instead of having to worry about a math test I am going to have to deal with no matter what I do now.  Why worry? Ignore it until you are there, spend an hour on the final, and be happy you finished it at all. Better than worrying for the next 14 hours about it."

3,"The American victory at Saratoga was an extremely important one. It ended the British plan to separate New England from the other colonies. It also showed European nations that the new country might really be able to win its revolutionary war. This was something that France, especially, had wanted ever since being defeated by the British earlier in the French and Indian War. \n\nThe French government had been supplying the Americans secretly through the work of America's minister to France, Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was popular with the French people and with French government officials. He helped gain French sympathy for the American cause. \n\nAfter the American victory at Saratoga, the French decided to enter the war on the American side. The government recognized American independence. The two nations signed military and political treaties. France and Britain were at war once again. The British immediately sent a message to America's Continental Congress. They offered to change everything so relations would be as they had been in 1773. The Americans rejected the offer. The war would be fought to the end. \n\nIn 1779 Spain entered the war against the British. And the next year, the British were also fighting the Dutch to stop their trade with America. The French sent gunpowder, soldiers, officers, and ships to the Americans. However, neither side made much progress in the war for the next two years."

3,"If you don't trust your knowledge in ChemE, you should consider going into a ""safe"" area of the industry where exercising poor engineering judgment isn't going to be catastrophic.  You may want to consider some of these options:\n\nPursue a Master's or Doctorate program in some other discipline, such as Law, Business or Journalism - whatever you have an interest in.\nPursue an undergraduate degree in another area.  You certainly have a lot of credits, so there are plenty of other areas where it wouldn't take that much more to graduate.\n\nAdditionally, having B and C grades in ChemE is not uncommon.  That is a very difficult major - and typically takes five years to complete.  Don't be down on yourself for those kind of grades.  But please bear in mind that if a prospective employer asks you about them (and they will), be prepared to explain and sell yourself in other areas - such as people skills, organizational skills, management experience, motivation, etc.  People skills and management experience are HUGE.  Grades are only part of the picture, so buck up and you'll be fine."

3,"Disaster management is an attempt to minimize the damage related to a disaster. By deffinition a disaster is something that was not avoided and causes catostropic damages. It doesn't have to be a twister or a hurricane or an earthquake. For many companies losing their data would be a worse disaster than losing the building they work from and the hardware they use to manipulate and read that data. \n\nDisaster plans, redundancy, security and emergancy resources are used to combat disasters. \n\nA disaster plan is where you decide upon all likely catastrophes to your business model and then decide what you will do to minimize the damage if this event occurs. Many companies have such plans. Many of them are actually good plans. Few follow through and even fewer update them on a reguler basis. So when real disaster strikes the plans are often forgotten or not followed. Disaster plans should be written after a good bit of analysis. If you look closely you will find that more than acts of God threaten a company.   So disaster plans should include acts of God (Volcano, Tornado, hurricane, whatever else applies to that area) major theft (both from external and internal sources), loss of data, terrorism, acts of cival disobediance (a riot in the area, being targeted by a radical political group are examples of this), Long term utility outages and anything specific to your industry such as the sudden loss of a key supplier or market for example.\n\nRedundancy is something that most people wish they could have but few can afford. If your enterprise hinges on a specific server, database, phone switchboard, etc then you cannot afford to not use redundancy. The downtime of a single failure will pay for the redundancy several times over in many cases. What it means is to have a backup unit of whatever it is that is essential to your operations. It might be a second generator, or an alternate hiway route or an extra server that does little or nothing unless the main server craters. \n\nSecurity is part of disaster management before during and after. It is typically securities job to prevent many forms of disaster. Security is who is often called upon to effect disaster plans when they are called into use. Security has to learn from previous disasters and improve performance after a disaster and is normally heavily involved with recovery efforts. \n\nEmergancy resources are things that you need to get your disaster plan working. For example if you live in a hurricane prone area where will you operate out of until it's clear to go back and you can reopen the office in the disaster area. Do you need generators for long term power outages or to survive brown outs. It's also identifying who in your company will do what if certain aspects of the disaster plan are enacted as well as knowing what Gov and private agencies will need to be talked to and who to talk too remain operational during a disaster. A bank for example after a major theft will have a book sized binder on this section where a small appliance repair store might have a couple sentances. \n\nHope this helped."

3,"Another good teamwork game is ""Titanic"". \n\nAs an intro have a discussion about what happened to the Titanic. Most kids will have seen the film, so they will have some idea of what happened.\n\nMark out 2 areas on the floor using masking tape. Each should be roughly the shape of a ship and big enough for everyone to stand inside at once. they should be as far appart as you can get them (I usually put them in diagonnaly opposite corners  of the room). Lable one ""Titanic"" and one ""Rescue Ship"". \n\nTell everyone to stand in Titanic and explain they are all passangers on the ship. They have to get to the Rescue ship. However, explain that they cannot go in the water (ie the floor between the 2 ships) because of sharks/icebergs. Fortunately there are some lifeboats left on Titanic which they can use to get to the rescue ship. \n\nThe lifeboats are in fact hula hoops. You need a minimum of 2, but 3 or 4 work better. Set some rules about the lifeboats: You are safe when you are standing in them. They can be picked up and moved around when they are empty but have to stay still when someone's stsnding in them. They can be passed from one person to another but not thrown. There is a maximum number of people who can stand in a lifeboat at one time - I usually say 4. You can step from one lifeboat to another but you can't jump between them.\n\nThe group has to work out how to get everyone to the rescue ship. The solution involves putting the lifeboats on the floor near Titanic, in a line heading towards the rescue ship. people step from Titanic into the first lifeboat, from the first lifeboat to the second and so on until all of the lifeboats except the one closest to Titanic are full, the last lifeboat is empty. Some people will have to wait behind on Titanic. One person picks up the empty lifeboat and passes it forward to a person in the lifeboat closest to the rescue ship. That person puts it on the floor and everyone moves forward, and repaets the process until they are at the rescue ship. When they get to the rescue ship, everyone gets into it except one person who does the procedure in reverse to go back to Titanic and pick up the next batch of passengers.\n\nOnce the group has worked out the solution you can change some of the rules about how many lifeboats there are or how many people can be in one boat at a time. \n\nI have tended to find it is a quieter, less pushy member of the group who will come up with the solution. The game works well with mixed ability and mixed age groups. For example I did it with a group of 11-year-olds and somebody's 3-year-old brother who happened to be there at the time. The group made quite big gaps between the lifeboats, but helped the 3-year-old get accross by picking him up and passing him from one person to another."

3,"In the beginning, there was Chaos, formless darkness, and from within Chaos emerged Gaia, Eros, Erebus and Nyx, (Earth, Love, Darkness and Night.) Gaia's first creation was her mate, Uranos, the Heavens, whom she created to be Her equal and partner. She then adorned herself with hills, rivers  and nymphs to watch over them, as well as the Old Man of the Sea, Pontus, without any help from her mate. She was the creatrix. \n\nEros caused them to desire one another, and Earth and Heaven produced many children together including the Hecatonchires, the Cyclopes and the Titans. The Titans had the power of creation, like their Parents, and Uranos was jealous of it and would not let them emerge from Her womb, though it was Gaia's intention that the power of Creation be passed on. Finally, She gave to Her youngest son Cronus a stone sickle and He snuck up on Uranos as He was bedding down with Gaia and castrated Uranos, who fled, and that is why the Heavens and the Earth are separate now. \n\nThe severed organ was cast into the Sea and gave rise to Aphrodite, the spirit of creative desire on Earth. Where the drops of blood fell on Earth sprung Giants, Erineyes (Furies) and Meliae (tree nymphs who later bore mankind). All of the Titans then emerged from Gaia's womb and began creating like mad, filling the Earth with mortal life and taking their rightful places as Gods and Goddesses of their various realms. Hyperion and Thea for example bore Dawn, the Sun and the Moon, etc.\n\n(Nyx and Erebus, by the way, are the parents of Dreams, Sleep, Fate, Doom, Nemesis, Strife, etc.)\n\nCronus, who as the one who freed them all from their imprisonment was now the King of the Gods,feared that one day He would have a son who would depose Him, so as each of His children were born to His wife Rhea, He swallowed them, as the Trojan Man had yet to be created. Finally, Rhea hid Her son, Zeus, and gave Cronus a stone to swallow.  Zeus grew up, hidden by Gaia and Uranos, and rased on honey by the Meliae and when He became an adult, He tricked Cronus into vomiting up all of His brothers and sisters. He also mustered some of the other children of Gaia, the Hecatonchires, for example and some of the Titans to depose Cronus and there was a great war and finally, Zeus & co. won and the other guys were cast into darkness. Zeus became King of the Gods. The end."

The behavioral science field is one of the lowest paid fields. Most jobs that require a psychology type degree start out around 22 to 25 thousand a year... sad for a bachelors degree. So basically, you better love what you are doing. For a masters level counselor you dont make all that much either unless you open up a private practice after you get your LPC.\n\nGood luck, it is a very demanding field with little to no rewards. Financial rewards are nonexsistant and emotional rewards are far and few in between.\n\nCounselorDan"

A GPA above 3.0 will not hurt you at all but the top schools.  Your GMAT score will probably count a bit more and should be at least 550, which is about the 50th percentile, but preferably 600, which is the 70th percentile.  Good recommendations from your previous professors and maybe employers can help, especially if the professors are well known in your desired area of study.  Beyond that, having a good attitude and being able to answer the questions ""Why do you want to come to this school and why do you want to study ...?"" will go a long way to helping go where you want to."

3,"A chemical reaction is material changing from a beginning mass to a resulting substance. The hallmark of a chemical reaction is that new material or materials are made, along with the disappearance of the mass that changed to make the new. This does not mean that new elements have been made. In order to make new elements, the nuclear contents must change. There are magnitudes of difference in the amounts of energy in ordinary chemical reactions compared to nuclear reactions, the rearrangement of the nuclei of atoms to change to new elements is enormous compared to the smaller energies of chemical changes. The alchemists, in their efforts to change less expensive metals to gold, did not have the fundamental understanding of what they were attempting to do to appreciate the difference. \n\nA chemical equation is a way to describe what goes on in a chemical reaction, the actual change in a material. Chemical equations are written with the symbols of materials to include elements, ionic or covalent compounds, aqueous solutions, ions, or particles. There is an arrow pointing to the right that indicates the action of the reaction. The materials to the left of the arrow are the reactants, or materials that are going to react. The materials to the right of the arrow are the products, or materials that have been produced by the reaction. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that in a chemical reaction no mass is lost or gained. The Law of Conservation of Mass applies to individual types of atom. One could say that for any element, there is no loss or gain of that element in a chemical reaction. There are such things as reversible reactions, reactions in which the products reassemble to become the original products. Reversible reactions are symbolized in chemical equations by a double-headed arrow, but the standard remains to call the materials on the left the reactants and the materials on the right the products."

3,"Hi, Kenny. You are asking for a lot of information. I have written a book, on the history of nuclear science and will link you to it to read online. This space here is awfully limited.\n\nThe short answer is that nuclear science allows us to generate electrical power out in space even when we are far away from stars like the sun. \n\nThere are two ways we do that:\n\n1. Nuclear reactors - just like the atomic power plants on earth, reactors depend upon the splitting of uranium or plutonium atoms to generate heat and then the heat is used to boil a liquid and turn a turbine. The turbine moves a coil of wire through a magnetic field and gives you electricity.\n\n2. Thermopyles - plutonium due to its alpha radioactive decay gets pretty hot naturally. If you put two dissimilar wires wrapped around each other in a heat source and then the other end of the wires in somewhere cold (like out in space), electrons will flow through them. This is called a thermocouple. If you put lots of those together, you have what is called a thermopyle. This kind of technology is pretty flawless and is used even for things like heart pacemakers."

These included the Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Babylonians, etc. Generally, new civillizations would come along and evict the other by force. Like the Babylonians started their empire after they kicked out the Sumerians.\n\nStill they had the same culture and religion mostly, so they are sometimes referred to as ancient mesopotamia. \n\nChina had more of an organized empire, and over time it built up extensive beauracracies to control the empire. At first it's central government was too weak (Zhao Dynasty), then too strong (Qin) and then just about right (Han). Still , Classical China was eventually conquered.\n\nMesopotamia mainly was slightly less advanced (they came before) and their government was a kingdom, while china had an Empire with the Mandate of Heaven. That is, the emperor claimed he was a god."

3,"Under a general anaesthetic, the new kidney is put into place, just above the groin. The artery to the kidney is sewn on to one of the lower abdominal arteries. The vein coming from the kidney is sewn on to one of the veins in the lower abdomen. The ureter which drains away urine is sewn into the wall of the bladder. Your own kidneys are not removed. A catheter is placed in the bladder and remains for 7 to 10 days until the bladder is healed. Sometimes the new kidney starts working at once. A lot of urine is passed. In a few patients, urine is not passed for some days, and occasionally not for some weeks: dialysis will continue to be needed during this time. Special drugs that suppress the so-called immune system are needed as soon as the kidney is put into place. These drugs aim to prevent the body from rejecting the new kidney. The drugs used are steroid (cortisone-like) drugs like prednisolone, together with azathioprine and cyclosporin. These drugs are taken as tablets once or twice a day. Some transplant centres use an additional drug, ATG, which has to be given directly into a large vein, usually in the neck. If the transplant is successful, with no complications, then the stay in hospital may be as short as 10 days. If there are problems the hospital stay may be several weeks."

3,"1.France, 2. United Kingdon, 3.Argentina -including mother country\n1. New Zealand 2. Argentina 3.Chile* - onlly population on Antartica\n\nI know what you're thinking, read below  for an explanation:\n\nland claims are governed by the antartic research treaty. No country may  colonize Antartica. However each country in the treaty (other \nnations may sign at any time, subject to the terms set) may establish a research base on Antartica, as long as it is used for relevant scientific research, provided that conductiong the research does not prove harmful to the enviroment. For example a research base could be  used to study penguins and global warming, but may not use its base for the testing of missiles or other weapons. \n\nIn the broad sense of the term country could applly to which county with a teritory in Antartica is largest, this leads to the answer above. In terms of which country's territory has the largest population, The Ross dependancy which is governed by New Zealand has almost 1,000 people during the summer.\n\n*Chile is unique, due to being geographically the closest of any nation with an Antartic claim, Because their so close and their claim is on the side of the continent closest to Chile, the Chilean goverment includes the claim in one of their proviences, bring the actual population their to over 200,000. However as all around 150 of these people live in Southern Chile (on South America) or the sourounding islands, not Antartica this number is greatly overinflated."

The choice is up to you, but for me it was a no brainer...\n\nAh, I also see you go to USC now. In my mind, that would be yet another reason to come to NYU. You won't have many more years in your life in which you can move to a totally new place. Experience the most you can, I always say. But then again, it is all up to you. Only you can make this choice. You shouldn't listen to those lists anyways. They are only made to sell anxious college applicants, magazines. If you really like it there, I'd consider staying.

3,"Ignoring the jerk response, your GPA is determined by ""quality"" or ""grade"" points, which involves knowing both the letter grade achieved in the course and the number of credit hours attempted. For instance, if your course was 3 credit hours and A=4, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B= 3.0, B- = 2.67, and so on:\n\nIf you got an A = 4 x 3 = 12 quality points\nC = 2 x 3 = 6 quality points\n\nFigure this out for all semesters, add the quality points together, and divide that number by the total credit hours attempted. This should be your GPA.  Remember, schools typically truncate scores to the second decimal place instead of rounding.\n\nThis may help if you need more examples, http://www.foothill.edu/transfer/counseling.calc.html\n\nEDIT: Check your transcript to see if the calculated quality points from previous semesters is listed.  Sometimes if you just add on this past semester's GPA onto yours from previous semesters, you'll get rounding errors.  Additionally, if you've got some time left in college, I made an excel spreadsheet sometime back that I use to keep track of grades.  It automatically figures out quality points the GPA.  Send me an email through my Answers profile if you're interested.\n\nSee if this helps: http://www.units.muohio.edu/saass/gpa_tool.htm"

Just make sure you get into a JuCo that has a good coach and a program that will get you ready for D-1.  On the other hand, if you are only a junior right now, you have a year and a half to get your grades up.  You might want to spend some time working on that.

These days we've lost much of the symbolism associated with them, but earlier painters chose flowers to convey very specific messages about their subjects. The meaning associated with a specific flower differs between cultures; the symbolism for each given here is from Western European culture unless specified otherwise.\n\nBamboo: A symbol for longevity (it's always got green shoots) as well as strength and grace (it bends readily but doesn't break easily). In Chinese philosophy the straight stem of bamboo symbolises the path towards enlightment, the segments of the stem being the steps along the way.\n\nCarnation: A symbol of betrothal or engagement. In China, a carnation is a symbol of marriage.\n\nChrysanthemum: The national symbol of Japan, 'mums are a symbol for long life.\n\nClover leaf: The three divided leaves of clover (also known as shamrock or wood sorrel) represent the Christian Holy Trinity of God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nKabbalah SymbolsGreat deals on Kabbalah Symbols \n\n\nThe national symbol of Ireland and of Ireland's patron saint, St Patrick (his feast day is 17 March).

A symbol of deception, danger, and death.\n\nForget-me-not: A low-growing plant (Myosotis) with small, usually blue flowers . As the common name suggests, a symbol of a plea for remembrance. ""Forget me not"" are supposed to have been the last words of young man who fell into a river and drowned while picking these flowers for his lover.\n\nHoneysuckle: A less-common symbol of love. Also of generosity.\n\nIris: Associated with death as Iris was a Greek goddess of the rainbow, which she used to travel down to earth with messages from the gods and to transport women's souls to the underworld. The three upright petals and three drooping sepals are symbols for faith, valour, and wisdom.\n\nJasmine: This strongly scented, white flower is used as a Hindu symbol for love.\n\nLily: Symbolises purity, chastity, and innocence. White lilies represent the purity of the Virgin Mary. The Angel Gabriel was often painted presenting Mary with a white lily when he announced to her that she would give birth to the Son of God.\n\nLotus: A common symbol in Asian art, the lotus symbolises birth and rebirth through the fact that the petals open when the sun comes out and close when the sun sets.

3,"Yes, speech language therapists have many different methods for helping a child who stutters. When you say ""communicate fluently"" stuttering is what I am assuming you mean. We use the term fluency in my profession when we are talking about a child who exhibits speech behavior such as blocking, repeating part of a word over and over, or prolonging a sound. A certified SLP really needs to fully evaluate the child and then make a treatment plan specifically designed for his specific fluency disorder. A good therapy program should consist of some goals to look at attitudes and feelings about speaking. If the child has a negative attitude about expression because talking is so hard, therapy will be tough. We often have to work on the feelings and emotions first. Another goal should focus on some type of speech modification techniques designed to increase the forward flow of speech. Some examples are easy onset, light contact, singing, and reciting rote speech (counting, ABC's, etc) just to name a few. Through managing the attitudes connected to the disorder in conjunction with modifying the speech output itself directly, the child will learn to ""manage"" their speech and be proactive in their own communication attempts. Finally, this is really a job for an SLP. Please consult with one. Your child should have one in the school that they attend."

How have I prepared for study in this field?\nWhy am I interested in this particular program?\nWhat is my potential specific area of interest?

Speak with your current professors before you apply, and ask about the strengths of various programs. You should already know which scholars are of greatest interest to you as mentors, but it is always wise to ask current professors if they know these scholars. (You may learn that Professor XX, while brilliant, is a lousy mentor for grad students.) \n\nHope this helps!"

MBA is oversold: you need to have 4-5 yrs experience to sell yourself to employers. \n\nA better idea may be to get a good job in systems in some firm such as Merill Lynch, etc through TCS and then go for MBA.

3,"LOL! I love this question. I have my own theory, and it is partly backed up by a conversation I had with a professor when I was in college.\n\nI think that some people devote most of their energy and time to thinking about the stuff that's going on inside their heads. When you are living a life ""of the mind"" there probably isn't a lot of time or energy left over for material concerns, including grooming. I read once that Einstein liked tennis shoes because they are comfortable, but that he seldom bothered to tie them because that was just a waste of time to him; he was busy thinking about other things.\n\nI had an art professor in college who is really an expert in his field. He always had a big bushy beard and his hair, while clean, was seldom combed. He would wear jeans with holes in them, and button down shirts that were wrinkled and, more often than not, buttoned incorrectly. More than once, he lectured on stage in shoes that didn't match. One day, we arrived at the lecture hall to find a notice saying that class was cancelled for the week, and that we should all go to the univerity's museum and write about our emotional response to the artwork of our choice. Class would resume the following Monday.\n\nThe following Monday, he showed up in nice dress slacks, dress shirt and tie. His beard had been trimmed and nicely shaped, and his hair had been cut and was neatly combed. We all discussed it and thought it was probably due to an important meeting or something. But he continued to be dressed and groomed that way. At the end of the term, I had an appointment with him to discuss a paper I was working on, and because we had a pretty good relationship, I finally came right out and asked him about the change in his appearance. \n\nHe laughed for a very long time before he gave me an answer. It turns out that he had been named both director of the entire Fine Arts Department and Chairman of the Museum Board. He had to go to meetings with all sorts of important people, including representatives from big museums who lent out artworks for the university's museum. His wife pointed out to him that he might be taken a bit more seriously if he looked a bit more professional. She got him to get a haircut, and he agreed to let her set out his clothing for the next day each night before they went to bed. They had to negotiate on the facial hair. She voted for a clean face, but he said shaving every day takes up too much time, so he agreed to keeping it groomed, and allowing her to trim it and shape it once a week. He told me that he believes strongly in focusing all his energy on one thing. When he is with his kids and wife, he is actively engaged in spending time with them and enjoying their company. When he is writing an article about an artwork, he said he takes pictures of it and posts them all around his house and office space, and keeps a notepad handy so he can jot down ideas as they come to him, and he spends every waking moment thinking about it. He then laughed again and said, ""You see, grooming just isn't that important or interesting to me. I bathe regularly, and I wear clean clothes, but other than that, it's just a waste of energy. Luckily, my wife is interested in it and is there to take up the slack and help me out."" So now, when I see an unkepmt professor, I just assume he or she is thinking about marvelous, deep things, and not about how they look to the rest of us."

3,"I remember there being a set of videos (and books) with the title ""Where there's a will there's an A"". I saw some of the videos myself, and thought there were many excellent tips. You can find about the videos and books here (or some other website if you just use a search engine):\n\nhttp://www.wheretheresawill.com/\n\nIn terms of inability to concentrate on something you're reading, usually it has something to do with not being motivated/interested in what you're reading.\nTherefore, my suggestion would be to find some way to make the reading interesting. \n\nThis is especially difficult if you don't find the reading interesting at all. So, if you're studying for an exam or something, the best thing to do is to attempt to read with a particular purpose in mind. For example, if you're studying the material for a multiple choice/essay exam, try to come up with questions you think would be on the test (i.e., that the teacher would ask you) about. If you're trying to memorize specific material, try mindmapping. Basically, as you read, you draw a diagram (that looks very much like a tree) that connects concepts you think are related.\n\nThe Where there's A Will videos will also tell you that when studying, always study for about 30-40 minutes, then take a 15-20 minute break. Your brain naturally gets bored after a half hour. If you don't want to take a break, then simple switch to different homework (the brain also gets bored with the same information after awhile)."
3,"In criminal cases, this generally involves obtaining samples from crime-scene evidence and a suspect, extracting the DNA, and analyzing it for the presence of a set of specific DNA regions (markers).\n\nScientists find the markers in a DNA sample by designing small pieces of DNA (probes) that will each seek out and bind to a complementary DNA sequence in the sample. A series of probes bound to a DNA sample creates a distinctive pattern for an individual. Forensic scientists compare these DNA profiles to determine whether the suspect's sample matches the evidence sample. A marker by itself usually is not unique to an individual; if, however, two DNA samples are alike at four or five regions, odds are great that the samples are from the same person.\n\nIf the sample profiles don't match, the person did not contribute the DNA at the crime scene."

Paleolithic human settlements by 125,000 year-old people using chert and quartz tools have been discovered at excavations in several cave sites in the Western Plains region and the South-western face of the Central Hills region. Paleo-anthropologists have shown that burial rites and certain decorative artifacts exhibit similarities between the first inhabitants of the island and the early inhabitants of southern India. One of the first written references to the island is found in the Indian epic Ramayana. The main written accounts of the country's history are the Buddhist chronicles of Mahavansa and Dipavansa.\n\n[edit]\nAncient history\nHistory of Sri Lanka\nseries \nEarly Sri Lankan History \nEuropean Occupation of Sri Lanka \nSri Lanka Independence Struggle \nIndependence of Sri Lanka \nEthnic conflict in Sri Lanka \nAccording to legend, the written history of the Sinhala people of the island begins with the arrival of an Indian prince named Vijaya and his followers. The story goes that when Vijaya arrived, there were indigeneous people already living in the country. Vijaya made a relationship with the queen of the indegenous people, Kuwani. Kuwani accepted Vijaya because she realized that her people could not successfully fight him. She gave birth to a son and daughter. There are two primary opinions about Vijaya's origins. Some historians believe that he set sail from what is now Orissa, while linguists point out that ancient Sinhala is closer to Sanskrit which is the basis for most Indian languages. Buddhism arrived from the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BC thanks to Arahath Mahinda Thero, missionary of Buddhist Indian Emperor Ashoka, and spread rapidly. Asoka requested his son Mahinda (Mahinda Thero) to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka as a favour for his best friend King Devanampiyatissa, king of Sri Lanka.\n\nAlthough the country's history is dominated by Sinhalese peoples, some chronicles do mention the presence of Tamil speaking people. There is no clearly established date for the arrival of Dravidian people on the island, but it is thought to have occurred soon after that group reached South India. South Indian kingdoms invaded Sri Lanka on several occasions because of the prosperity of the country, and parts of the island, especially areas close to India, were ruled at times by Dravidian dynasties such as the Cholas, Pandyas, Cheras and Pallavas. The island was also invaded and ruled by Kings of Kalinga (present-day Indian state of Orissa) and Malay Straits. In general, when Sinhalese kings became aware of Tamils' presence in the country they were able to expel them to India; however, Tamils were established on the island by the time the colonial period began.\n\n \nLanding of King Vijaya depicted in a paintingFrom the ancient period date some remarkable archaeological sites including the ruins of Sigiriya, the so-called ""Fortress in the Sky"", and huge public works. Among the latter are large ""tanks"" or reservoirs, important for conserving water in a climate that alternates rainy seasons with dry times, and elaborate aqueducts, some with a slope as finely calibrated as one inch to the mile (1:60,000).\n\n[edit]\nColonial rule\nIn 1505 the Portuguese arrived on the island, and colonial rule began. At that point the island consisted of several autonomous kingdoms, such as those of Yarlpanam (Anglicised Jaffna) in the north and Kandy in the central hills. The Dutch arrived in the 17th century. During Portuguese and Dutch rule of coastal areas, the interior, hilly region of the island remained independent, with its capital in Kandy. Great Britain replaced the Dutch in 1796, and the coastal areas became a crown colony in 1802. After the fall of Kandy kingdom in 1815, the British unified it with the 'l"

3,Well to begin with it wasn't a War it was considered a Police action. The United States was just one of many nations belonging to the U.N. that sent troops to protect the south Koreans from falling under communist rule being imposed on them by the Russian supported North Koreans. communist China also entered the conflict as allies to North Korea. The U.S.\nled United Nation forces fought the communist onslaught to a stalemate after three years which was enough to bring North Korea to the Peace Talks and reach an agreement for a ceasefire. there was no end to the conflict right now there is a large number of U.S. Soldiers keeping watch over a stretch of land called the DMZ [demilitarized zone] that separates the north from the south. The North Koreans have their own soldiers standing guard watching over the DMZ. Because it was just a ceasefire agreement and not a declaration to end hostilities a shooting war could break out again at any time.

If you are now making a C, your grade is less than 77% and greater than or equal to 73%. Let X be your actual percentage and Y be the portion of your grade that is comprised of the upcoming exams. Suppose that you make 100% on your exams. Then to get at least a B+, X*(1-Y)+Y≥87%. This means that X-XY+Y≥87%, Y*(1-X)+X≥87%, Y*(1-X)≥87%-X, Y≥(.87-X)/(1-X). We know your grade is less than 77%, so substituting that for X, Y>(.87-.77)/(1-.77), Y>.1/.23, Y>43.47826% (approx.). (The reason we switched from ≥ to > is because we know your grade cannot be exactly .77, and all lower grades will increase the value of y). That means, that unless your final exams constitute at least 43.47826% of your grade, it is absolutely impossible for you to pull your grades up to a B+."

3,"Magwitch is a convict who escapes from a prison ship (hulk) near the marshes where Pip lives. They come across each other at a nearby cemetery, and Magwitch threatens Pip to get him food and a file so he can break off his handcuffs(but all this must be done in secret so not to reveal where Magwitch has escpaed to). When Pip returns with Magwitch has asked for, it touches him. A few days pass and guards from the hulks come to Pip's uncle, Joe the blacksmith, to fix some of their handcuffs so  they can capture some escaped convicts. Joe asks the guards if they would mind if him and Pip went with them to see (he thinks it is a treat for Pip. Though secretly Pip is terrified that they will find out that he helped Magwitch, but he goes along regardless). They find and arrest the convict, who Pip's suprise, does not reveal how he got the file and food. Years pass, and Pip grows up wealthy because of an secret benefactor who pays for him becoming a gentleman. On his 21st birthday, Pip is astonished to find out that his benefactor is indeed the convict on marshes so long ago (he had thought it was a wealthy lady named miss havisham who always acted as though she was his benefactor). With help from his friend Herbert, Pip sucessfully hides the convict (if discovered death by hanging would be the punishment). Pip later however learns that the conman(Compeysenson) who got Magwitch arrested in the first place, is in London looking for him. Magwitch still remains sucessfully hidden and Pip decides that it is best that Magwitch be taken out of the country (first by rowboat, then he would be smuggled into a bigger ship). They do this and everything goes well, but just as Magwitch is about to get on the bigger ship, Compeysen shows up in with the police in a rowboat and points him out. They bring magwitch back to their boat to arrest them, but once they get there Magwitch pushes Compeysen under the water and the two wrestle. Magwitch is the only one to return from beneath the surface, and is taken away to a prison where he spends the rest of his life. Pip vists him everyday and tells him about his daughter, Estella (who was beleieved to be dead because of her violent mother (magwitch's ex-wife)) is actually alive and living with the wealthy Miss Havisham. Magwitch does not live much more after this and dies due to illness.\n\n*Hope this helped!*"

I also think that creationism, which is also a theory that is commonly accepted, but is also something that cannot be scientifically proven at this point, should also be taught in schools.\n\nThe problem is that the scientific community is extremely defensive about losing respect for the theory of evolution, because it is still such a young theory, that they are not being respectful to the idea that part of science includes questioning theories.\n\nReligious scholars also tend to be too strict, not considering, perhaps, that evolution could be guided by God, or that evolutionary patterns may have been put into place at some starting point that was already evolved.

Basically, you want to argue your main point (or thesis) by giving 3 (sometimes more or sometimes less, but 3 is ""typical"") main reasons why what you are saying is ""right"".  \n     Let's say I want to argue that walking is good for you.  Okay, the first paragraph is what most people would call an ""introductory"" paragraph.  In this paragraph, you would basically introduce what your main point is and then you would add in what your main three points are...but you would do this in a way that would stretch it out to where its not just one sentence (because this is a paragraph we are talking about here).  A good starter sentence I always use is ""When most people hear the word [BLANK], many words come to mind, such as [BLANK BLANK and BLANK], but what many do not know is that [BLANK] is actually [BLANK].""  Get the point?  You have to stretch it out some.  Lure the reader in, if you will.  \n     So then after your intro paragraph, you would introduce your first point (which you already mentioned in the intro paragraph).  Then after you mention your first reason why you are ""right"", you back it up with some FACTS.  You wouldn't say ""I believe walking is good for you because my friend Judy said it was.  So there.""  You would have to go and look at some RESOURCES such as a dictionary, encyclopedia, TRUSTED news sites on the internet, TRUSTED books and other medias from your public/school library, and also, perhaps interviews with people who are ""authorities"" on the subject.  So, let's say your first reason you think walking is good for you is because it lowers your blood pressure.  You then would have to say that the BlahBlah Encyclopedia or Yahoo News reported that walking has been proven by doctors at Columbia University that walking lowers blood pressure.  You could also use your mom's interview if she said that that walking personally lowered her blood pressure.  And you would just prove prove prove using FACTS (that's how you win any arguement, if you ask me).   \n     So then, after you have done this with all three reasons why you are ""right"", you then do your 5th paragraph which is what most people call the ""conclusion"" paragraph.  You just ""wrap up"" everything you just said and maybe add a little personal opinion or a little little quote.  Something to ""jazz"" it up...this is to keep the reader interested until the very end.  This is also called a ""clincher"".  \n     Hope this helped some."

3,"I think you mean capsulitis. Adhesive capsulitis is the medical name for a frozen shoulder. For what ever reason, pain or injury, you stop using and moving your shoulder joint much. This causes it to ""freeze"" because of shortening of the ligaments and tendons as well as muscle atrophy caused by disuse. Rehab is the only way to get things working again and if it is severe enough sometimes the doctor will have to manipulate the shoulder with you under anasthesia before you can be sent to therapy."

3,"Teddy Roosevelt said this many years ago and I beleive it is still very true today. I think that anyone should be welcomed to America so long as they respect American values. What language a person chooses to speak in their own homes is their choice, but every should AT LEAST know how to speak English and be able to navigate their way around the country without us having to post everything in several languages for them. \n\nMr. Roosevelt said the following in 1919.  What do you think?\n\n""In the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the man's becoming in very fact an American, and nothing but an American...\n\nThere can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag, and this excludes the red flag, which symbolizes all wars against liberty and civilization, just as much as it excludes any foreign flag of a nation to which we are hostile...We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language...and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people.""\n\n--Theodore Roosevelt, 1919"

3,"Sorry this will be a bit long... but if you want to get good answer to questions about the meaning of names you need to know which sources and sites you can trust... so I'll try to point out why certain sites are NOT good sources.\n\nIn general, I do not trust the meanings given in the ""baby name"" sites.  Some are correct, same are way off!  Too much sloppy work and failture to co-ordinate related forms to rely on them.\n\nOne evidence of unreliability is this -- If you check out the ""name-meanings"" and ""babyname"" sites mentioned above and search for the list of names below --ALL of which are derived from the same Germanic name (""Karl""), you will find meanings that have nothing to do with each other!      \n\nCharles, Carl, Karl, Carlos\nCarla, Carlotta, Charlotte, Charlene\nCarol, Caroline \n(there are others, but they are unlikely to appear in English)\n\nEsp. laughable is what happens when you choose one of the FEMININE forms.  Some may properly say ""from Charles"", but others end up as ""melody"" (for ""Carol"" -- but this is NOT the meaning of the NAME!), ""feminine"",  ""beautiful woman"", etc. \n\nNow it IS true that since ""carol"" is a word for a type of song or hymn, people MAY choose the name for that meaning, and say it means that.  No problem there, even if that's not the way the name originally came about...  language is like that!  But in any case the names do NOT mean ""feminine"" or ""beautiful"".\n\nAlso, since names, like other words, can change meaning over time, some variation is understandable.  (Thus the negative word ""churl"" is derived from ""Carl"", but that does not mean the name Carl has that meaning.)\n\nBut that's not what's going on with the baby books and baby-name sites.  They are often trying to make the names sounds interesting and attractive (telling a girl her name is a feminine form of ""man"" or ""warrior"" may not be well received!) But in the process they are often far from correct!\n\nOn the other hand I have found ""behindthename.com"" to avoid such sloppiness.   They try to present the most reliable info they can.  For a cluster of names, ALL the names will eventually take you to one main entry that explains the derivation and meaning.  In this case all the names listed above end up at the ""Charles"" article.\n\nSo we discover that there is a bit of uncertainty/debate about whether the name simply means ""man"" (or in some cultures a particular status of man, such as a ""free man"") OR is from a Germanic root ""heri"" for ""war"", hence meaning ""warrior"" (the sort of name used quite often in Germanic cultures).\n\nBy the way ""farmer"" is not very helpful here.   It may be that in some societies the typical work of the ""(free)man"" was as a farmer, but that does not mean this word itself MEANS ""farmer"".\n\nWikipedia's article on the name is also quite good, and adds a bit of history and a hint at how the name could be related to status in society (which may make it difficult to fully translate, since our societies do not have that same structure)\n\nSo, check out the details at these two links:\nhttp://www.behindthename.com/php/search.php?nmd=n&terms=charles\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_(name)\n(which includes a nice list of masculine and feminine forms as well as surnames)"
3,"From Wiki:""The use of the Greek letter π for this constant is derived from Greek words like περιφέρεια (for periphery) and περίμετρον (for perimeter) starting with this letter.\nThe name of the Greek letter π is pi, and this spelling is used in typographical contexts where the Greek letter is not available or where its usage could be problematic. When referring to this constant, the symbol π is always pronounced like ""pie"" in English, the conventional English pronunciation of the letter.""\n\nFrom Online Etymology Dictionary:\nPi: ""1841, used in L. 1748 by Swiss mathematician Leonhart Euler (1707-83), from Gk. letter pi (from Heb., lit. ""little mouth"") as an abbreviation of Gk. periphereia ""periphery."" ""\n\nMy initial guess was that it was derived from Latin, since many of our words have Latin origins.  But, apparently it is Greek in origin and is used because the Greek symbol Pi means perimeter thus corresponding to circles."
3,"Which particular differences did you have in mind to remove?  Like maybe eliminating anyone who isn't a particular skin color?  Or who speaks with the wrong accent?  Or who doesn't believe in a certain religion?  I'm a little frightened by the brainwashing implied by your question.\n\nI'm sorry, but I think I prefer the differences the way they are.  Here in America -- well, California (okay, *parts* of California) -- we appreciate diversity, not homogeneity.\n\nThough if by ""differences"" you mean ""armed conflicts"", well ... I think the only way to do that would be to start teaching that war and mass violence is always wrong even when done to suppress a worse evil.  As long as we consider warriors to be heros, people will create unnecessary conflict."

3,"In the 1960's people did many of the same things that you do today.  We had all of the advantages of modern times however we were not so sexually promiscuous.  Abortion was not legal, and the pill was still in the experimental stages.  In the late sixties that changed and coupled with a sudden onslaught of marajuana there came about a period called free love when many people experimented with new found sexual freedom and a sub culture of drug experimentation began.\n\nMore people read avidly the Internet was far from  available and really would not be used by just everyone for many more years.  I just read that someone said we listened to the radio... we listened to music on the radio but dramatic programs on the radio ceased when television became popular shortly after WWII by the time the sixties rolled around pretty much everyone had color tv.\n\nWe debated a great deal there were many social changes in the making.  Mom's were making the move into the job  market and it created great angst in many homes when women left there homemaking chores for jobs that paid actual money.  \n\nThere was a war in SE Asia and we were all very anxious about our friends and loved ones there.  In fact it can be truly said that anyone who had not been there had someone they knew or loved who had.  It was incredibly frightening we watched on the news every night afraid that we would not see our loved one and afraid if we did it would not be the kind of sight that we wanted to see.\n\nMeanwhile at home there was huge social change as racial equality became the issue of the day.  Not everyone on either side rapidly embraced the changes as there was fear coming at this issue from every direction.  Bad as things are now huge strides have been made and we applaud them many of us risked a great deal to make these changes happen.\n\nSocial life did not revolve around anyone thing, not everyone went to church in fact it was the beginning of a time when folks who had gone to church started to fall away people were disillusioned with all the distruction caused in the war and many blamed God.\n\nThere was a new awakening with regard to the enviornment we wanted to leave the world a better place for our children and we had huge debates on how to make that happen.  There were more young people in the United States than old people a result of the post  WWII baby boom.  The country for a time put all of its emphasis on what to do with all those young folks.\n\nI hope that helps there's tons more.  I was born in 1946 I remember the sixties well and I can tell you this.  There were such wonderful and diverse things happening that it would be impossible to put them all here.  Please don't use blanket statements when you refer to the people of that era it would be as inaccurate to do so as it would to say that all people living today like hip hop.  It was a large world with a huge population even then and if we had anything in common with each other it was that we were all doing our own thing.  Much as people do today."

3,"Scott Petersen:\n\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. — Scott Peterson had proof of his alibi close at hand when police questioned him a few hours after his pregnant wife was reported missing, an investigator testified Tuesday.\n\nModesto police detective Jon Evers told jurors that, when he asked him about a fishing trip to the San Francisco Bay, Peterson immediately produced corroboration of his story.\n\n""I had a quick conversation with Scott about where he went fishing, Berkeley Marina. And he said, 'In fact, I have a parking receipt. Would you like to see it?'"" Evers said.\n\nThe receipt showed Peterson parked at the launch at 12:54 p.m. on Dec. 24, 2002, the day his wife, Laci, vanished.\n\nUnder questioning by Senior Deputy District Attorney Rick Distaso, the detective appeared to suggest Peterson was overeager to provide the receipt. But later, a defense lawyer noted Evers testified in a pretrial hearing that Peterson only handed over the receipt when the detective asked for it.\n\nEvers told lawyer Mark Geragos he did not remember giving that answer, but said he did not dispute a transcript of that October preliminary hearing.\n\nA patrol officer at the time, Evers told jurors in Peterson's double-murder trial about his conversation with the 31-year-old fertilizer salesman in Christmas Eve night.\n\nEvers filled out the missing person report and surveyed the couple's home four times —including twice with the defendant.\n\nThough much of his testimony mirrored that of more junior officers who testified Monday, Evers offered jurors several new pieces of information.\n\nHe said he asked Peterson about a pair of duffle bags in a spare bedroom ""that looked like they had been disturbed.""\n\n""He said something like, well, he's just a slob. They were just there because he's a slob,"" Evers said.\n\nThe comment may raise eyebrows with jurors because the Peterson home was extremely neat. Laci Peterson, a devotee of Martha Stewart, was known to keep a very orderly and meticulously decorated house.\n\nMoreover, Evers said, Scott Peterson told officers that he washed his clothes from the fishing trip immediately upon returning home and even before searching for his wife.\n\nEvers, as other police officers have testified, said there were no signs of a struggle in the house. However, a few things struck him as noteworthy, including two mops and a bucket, a pile of rags and a small rug scrunched like an accordion against a door leading outside.\n\n""I thought it was kind of odd that it was pushed up against the door,"" Evers said.\n\nPeterson, he testified, blamed the family pets and immediately tried to straighten the rug.\n\n""He said, 'Oh, the cat and dog must've been playing in here,'"" Evers said. ""He took one or two steps forward, took the toe of his foot, put it on the corner of the rug, and tried to pull it out.""\n\nThe rug remained slightly askew and crumpled, the detective said.\n\nOn cross-examination, Geragos suggested the rugs ultimately meant nothing in terms of the investigation, but the detective hedged.\n\n""Did you see anything that would indicate that rug had any instrumentality in a homicide?"" Geragos asked.\n\n""At that time or later?"" Evers said.\n\n""At that time,"" Geragos said.\n\n""No,"" the detective replied."

3,"Yes. The Hindenburg you often hear about was indeed a German citizen. This was around 1900 to no later than 1910. His real family surname name was ""von Hindenburg"". He was a General as I recall at that period in history. The dirigible ""The Hindenburg"" was named such in his honor. The dirigible was filled with hydrogen the same stuff that is used to power up rockets such as the Space Shuttle. During this time the German's were causing some unease around the world by talking about starting up another war. Because of this the U.S. of A. which has the only large source of helium which is a non-flammable gas, wouldn't sell the Germans any of it. When the Hindenburg was coming in to it's docking port at Lakehurst, NJ on it's maiden voyage it would seem a static discharge occured. There was supposed to have been a grounding wire that was to have been dropped from the craft before it docked at it's mooring. That didn't happen. As a result the static charge ignited the hydrogen in the airship and along with some very graphic film footage that was shot of the catastrophy there was a news reporter who provided commentary on the event who understandably lost it all in a very emotional display in his report. We are also left with the image of the thing burning on a rather controversial rock & roll album cover.\n\nThere have been two movies done about the tragedy and many T.V. documentary's. It has been proven I believe without a shadow of a doubt a static electric discharge ended the Hindenburg and perhaps any possiblity of lighter than air craft ever becoming popular.\n\nThe hanger that the Hindenburg was supposed be kept in is still there. It's enormous! Clouds form inside the thing and it has it's very own weather system!\n\nSorry about the dates! Obviously they aren't a strong point with me. The Hindenburg as with any airship in the Zeppelin Class they aren't blimps. Dirigibles are rigid structures. The dirigibles were made of aluminum I believe. I also believe they were the first large scale use of that material. Blimps on the other hand are like balloons or nothing more than large bags of air. An example here are all of the airships in the Goodyear Rubber Co. fleet. They have just launched another one of these things and they are seeking a name for it. There is a competition for the name search. I don't recall the details I suggest checking out their corporate website."

An average 3rd grader's reading level is what is considered ""3rd grade level.""\n\nThis is very much like Procrustes' bed... if you're too short for the bed you get stretched, and if you're too tall for the bed you get your legs chopped off.\n\nThen, NCLB set a standard that ALL students, including those whose environmental impacts (e.g. non-English speaking home, physical/physiological disabilities, abusive homes, low-income homes, etc.) interfere with their learning rates, be able to perform at that ""grade level"" marker set by students who are not contending with these other variables.  In other words, NCLB, with that ""100% of all students will read at grade level"" goal, demands that the following children all read English at grade level by the age of 8:\n--a child with severe learning disabilities, who cannot naturally and efficiently process visual symbology into language like his/her peers can, due to physiological wiring issues in his/her brain\n--a child with mental retardation, whose natural learning rate is 200 to 1000 times slower than the ""average"" child\n--a child who is blind and deaf\n--a child in a persistent vegetative state\n--a child whose first exposure to English was that year, and who never speaks English at home\n--a child who has been through severe emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse, who is unable to concentrate due to anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nand so on.\n\nEach and every one of these different, ""non-average"" children CAN LEARN....but at their own potential rates, not at some ""average"" marker. The whole purpose of Special Education, ESL programs, etc. is to help students whose situation is outside the ""average"" learn to their individual full potential.\n\nTeacher accountability should require consistent demonstrated, reasonable levels of growth in ALL their students (no plateaus or regressions), at those students' levels of potential. Average kids should be expected to make at least one grade-level gain. Gifted children should be expected to make at least 1.5 to 2 grade level gains each year. Special education students should be making gains commesurate with their IQ scored potentials combined with developmental expectations (e.g. children with learning disabilities are often not developmentally ready to learn fluent reading until the age of 10 or so....small gains in some skills can be made until the developmental ""leap"" happens). ELL students should make gains in their English skills based on ""foreign language"" learning rates, not native speaker rates.\n\nPortfolio documentation of student progress from August to May, an 80% (B) passing grade rather than 60% (D), no cap on retaining students in grade level, automatic referral for special ed services if a student has been held back 2 or more times for not earning a B average in the regular ed setting (if not already identified and tested/admitted to specialized programming earlier), real accoutability laid on parents rather than schools for student attendance and discipline, teacher professional development based on real student need and not political considerations/program adoptions, and smaller teacher/staff to student ratios in all areas and categories to give each student more individualized instruction time, would be truly effective.\n\nNCLB as it stands appears to be an attempt to cut education from the federal budget while using teachers as scapegoats."

The main things to work on are maintaining or increasing GPA, obtaining good recommendations, writing a good essay, studying for the GRE, and networking! As for your summer, take a couple of classes you can relax in and study for the GRE. Grad school admissions will probably ask what summer experience you've gotten so its best to either volunteer or work for something computer-related, in your case. I would try to find a local computing company willing to take a volunteer worker with your CE knowledge or apply for a technical aide position. The key is to make the best of your experience this summer. If those don't work, try to obtain an undergrad research position at your school under a professor. Research might be also to pay for your hours of work or you can do it for volunteer, whatever will take up a lot of that free time you have. Stay busy and you'll be able to make the best of your time.\n\nTo improve your chances in graduate school, follow the suggestions I spoke about and try talking with grad students you might know and professors.

It usually accompanies a change of habitat or of habits but may occur without such change. It was once thought that in those cases where the animal's habitat remains unchanged metamorphosis followed a series of forms representing evolutionary ancestors of the species in question (see ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny), but this is no longer thought to be true.\n\nThe first type of metamorphosis is illustrated by many insects and by amphibians. Immature dragonflies are aquatic though the adults are flying insects, and frogs undergo a metamorphosis from an aquatic tadpole to an amphibious adult form. Change of habits is illustrated by the transformation of the free-swimming young of many aquatic invertebrates into sessile adults (eg sea squirts), and the development of butterflies and moths from caterpillars with chewing mouthparts into flying insects with sucking mouthparts.\n\nThe second type is illustrated by many crustacean species, whose young undergo significant physical metamorphosis without changing habits or habitat significantly.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis_%28biology%29\n\n\nIf you are referring to the work of Kafka by this name, then see these:\nwww.sparknotes.com/lit/metamorph/\nwww.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/metamorphosis/"

3,"First of all, calm down, breathe, and relax.  You have three weeks.  You can do this and make a good grade, I promise.\n\nYour paper is supposed to be persuasive, so that means that you need to find a topic that has pros and cons.  And then you have to take a side, for or against.  Think about this one, because you want your topic to be something you care about.  If you care, you'll write a deeper, more impassioned paper, and earn a better grade.\n\nA word about topics: I'd steer clear of abortion, because it's personal.  What works for one person doesn't work for another, and there's no changing people's minds about deeply personal matters.  Likewise, I wouldn't recommend religion either.  Death and taxes are good, though.  Is burial better than cremation?  Should there be a flat tax or not?\n\nThe next step is your actual research.  Make sure that your topic isn't too broad (The Punic Wars) or too narrow (the use of the short sword in hand-to-hand fighting during the Punic Wars).  This means you're going to have to go to the library and read lots of books, and look online, and go through the archive stacks.  Expect to spend about one hour researching for every page you write.\n\nWhen writing a good research paper, it's important to think like a lawyer.  That is, you need to pretend as if you're presenting your paper as if it were a court case.  Your teacher is the judge, and the prosecution is out to disprove your case.  A really good persuasive paper takes into account all the ""Yeah, but what about...?"" questions.  If you can answer, logically, precisely and clearly, any questions that someone arguing the opposite point can bring up, you will prove your case, and make your argument airtight.  (I use argument here in the classic sense of presenting a thesis for consideration.)\n\nYour conclusion should not simply restate your introduction, but rather go beyond the introduction.  You should think critically and give valid, on-point reasons why your idea is better, more practical, more valid, and overall how it benefits people more.\n\nIf you can do this, you will have written an ""A"" persuasive paper.  Please feel free to contact me if you need anymore help.\n\nCheers, K (teacher for 14 years)"

3,"Take it from me, seriously. I'm in grad school right now, and getting killed with all the course load!\n\n1) Don't ever quit or switch because you think you don't like what you're doing. MAKE SURE you're decision is based on whether you ACtuALLY like or dislike what you're doing, as opposed to just being lazy about the workload. Don't fool yourself.\n2) If you're not sure what you like, audit a couple of other courses outside of your field. Sit in their class, listen to the prof, do the readings if possible. It takes time, effort and resolve, but if you do it, it's worth it.\n3) A good idea is to ""chart"" your life backwards. Where do you want to be in 15 years? What do you need to do prior to that to reach that goal (your sub goal)? And what should you do prior to your subgoal to reach it (so your sub-subgoal), and so on, until you reach where you are. This is very important. It makes you THINK what kind of a life you want to have. Are you happy with just a moderate income and a happy family, or do you want riches? Your answer will narrow the fields of study. If you want luxury, you shouldn't be in... say, philosophy.\n4) There are many people who have a job that they don't like, and ultimately, you might be the kind of person that has no passion for anything.

3,"Both inhibition and stimulation begin with the same action, release of some signal from a presynaptic neuron onto a postsynaptic neuron.  In most cases, this is a chemical signal where the presynaptic neuron releases small amounts of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft between the pre and postysnaptic neurons.  The neurotransmitter then binds to a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane which then leads to some change in the postsynaptic neuron.  This change could be immediate (opening and/or closing of channels in the membrane) or delayed (activation of some chemical cascade within the neuron).\n\nGenerally, inhibition of a postsynaptic neuron occurs when these changes result in a decrease in the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell will fire an action potential.  This could be by increasing the polarization of the cell membrane or by interfering with processes/channels that would otherwise cause the cell to depolarize.\n\nExcitatation of a postsynaptic neuron is when the effect of the cell causes the cell to increase it's likelihood of firing either by opening channels that cause the balance of ions on either side of the membrane to become less polarized, or by decreasing the threshold required for the cell to fire an action potential.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the neurotransmitter does not determine if the presynaptic effect on the postsynaptic neuron is either excitatory or inhibitory, but rather the events that follow neurotransmitter binding to the postsynaptic receptor.  In other words, the chemical doesn't determine what happens to the cell, the action of the receptor does."

3,"I teach online at an accredited school (make your school is accredited or your classes/degree will be worthless) and I've taken classes as well.\n\nJust like traditional classes, each teacher is different and will have her or his own policies:  some will require you to log on for a minimum number of days each week, others will specify which days you are to take exams, and others are even more flexible by allowing you to complete the course at your own pace.\n\nLike the first answerer stated, the responsibility to manage your own schedule is paramount:  this is where a lot of students get into trouble.  Unlike the traditional class, you don't have to be in class on a particular day or time, so it is easy to decide to log in later--and before you know it, you've fallen behind and there is no way to catch up.  That's the biggest problem I've seen as an instructor.  Lectures are given online, so there is actually more reading in the online class than there is in the traditional class.  Some instructors will have multimedia presentations and demonstrations, so you will have to be sure that you have all the relevant software from the start of the semester or quarter--your instructor should provide a list for you.\n\nMy advice is to keep a regular schedule for when you will log on and work on the class; keep to a study schedule as well; if possible, submit work early since it is so easy to fall behind; and be sure to connect with other students in class--usually, there is a discussion board set up for that and classmates often help each other out which makes more enjoyable and can help you with mastering the content.\n\nLastly, expect that on occasion there will be technologoy glitches, e.g., either the school's server will go down, or there will be a problem with your computer.  This is another reason to submit work early so that you are not panicking while trying to get an assignment in at the last minute.\n\nI hope that is helpful!  All the best to you!"

Tell them sure they could close the account and give them their money and COUNT THE MONEY OUT SLOWLY, act normal even if the lines were long, don't stress out, etc etc, after a few days of doing this, eventuallly things seemed normal and the panic dwindled down to normal. \n\nStill researching...for sites\n\nthis one is good really good MSN seems to always provide good information it's 2 pages though http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584403/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States.html also a few other sites.

3,"(m)\n\nUrgent request, plea, or entreaty; enticing, asking. The criminal offense of urging someone to commit an unlawful act.\n\nThe term solicitation is used in a variety of legal contexts. A person who asks someone to commit an illegal act has committed the criminal act of solicitation. An employee who agrees in an employment contract not to solicit business after leaving her employer and then mails a letter to customers asking for business may be sued by the former employer for violating the non-solicitation clause of the contract. The letter constitutes a solicitation. However, if the person had placed a newspaper advertisement, this would not have been a solicitation because a solicitation must be addressed to a particular individual.\n\nMany solicitations in everyday life appear to be legal. For example, a telemarketer who tries to sell a legitimate product by calling potential customers is making a solicitation. It may or may not be legal, however, depending on the laws of the states where the telemarketer and the caller reside. If either of the states requires that telemarketers register with the state government, then the legality of the solicitation will depend on whether the telemarketer met this registration requirement. Failure to register may make the telemarketing company liable for civil fines or criminal penalties.\n\nSolicitation laws and regulations govern specific types of organizations and economic activities. For example, charitable organizations must register with state agencies before legally soliciting money. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission has rigid rules concerning the solicitation of shareholders for votes involving changes in corporate structure or leadership.\n\nCriminal solicitation commonly involves crimes such as prostitution and drug dealing, though politicians have been convicted for solicitation of a bribe. The crime of solicitation is completed if one person intentionally entices, advises, incites, orders, or otherwise encourages another to commit a crime. The crime solicited need not actually be committed for solicitation to occur.\n\nWhen law enforcement agencies seek to curtail prostitution, they use decoy operations. A person who offers to perform a sex act with an undercover officer for money can be arrested for solicitation of prostitution. Police decoys are also used to nab customers. When a person looking to pay for sex approaches a decoy officer and makes, by words or gestures, this request, the person can be arrested for solicitation of prostitution. Similar operations are used to reduce the sale of narcotics."

3,"The answer is {2,-1}which is x=2, y= -1.  You have to put the problem in brackets {  3x - 2y=4  }, {2x+ y= 5} and then multiply each formula to cancel one element out. ( 2 )  times {3x - 2y=4}  and ( -3)  times {2x+ y= 5}.  Then you cancel out the { 6x - 4y = 8} and { -6x - 3y + -15}.  You can subtract the second equations X's and add the Y's and you get.  {-7y  = -7}.  You divide both sides by -7 and you get y = 1.  Then you use the original second equation and move the 2x to the =5 side.  YOu get {y= 5 - 2x.}  You substitute 1 for y, and turn the formula to {1 = 5 - 2x}  {subtract 5 from both sides and get {-4 = -2x.}  x=2.  Hope that answered your question."

As a song title, it is a proper noun, but the word, and variations, has entered the English language as an adjective. It is one of the longest words in the English language.\n\nThe song describes using the word as a miraculous way to talk oneself out of difficult situations, and even as a way to change one's life. The song appears in the film's animated sequence where Mary Poppins is harangued by reporters after winning a horse race and responds to one claiming there are not words to describe her feelings of the moment. Mary disagrees with that and begins the song about one word she can use."

3,"Java refers to the programming language.\nIt's key features are:\n1. Your java source can run on multiple operating systems (Unix, Windows) due to the following architecture:\nA. Java source code is compiled into a platform independent byte-code \nB. Java byte-code is interpreted by a platform specific Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\n2. I think that the greatest benefits are of Java are that:\nA. It is a strongly typed (You don't have to deal with subtle errors caused by implicit type conversions - like an Array to a String)\nB. It is object oriented (see: wikipedia.org)  and has class-based inheritance (Easy re-use of functionality without the confusion of inheriting from multiple classes)\nC. It does not allow direct access to pointers to memory (prevents you from accidently reading from or writing to memory intended for another application)\nD. It is multi-threaded.  (For example, it's relatively easy to implement a word processor checks your spelling and grammar while you type.  You type in the main thread and the spell check runs in a separate thread, so your typing is not held up while the spell check runs.)\n\nj2se or Java 2 Standard Edition, contains the JVM and Compiler that I mentioned above under ""key features""\nas well as an extensive set of built in classes.  Data Structures that ship with the j2se - such as the Collections API are a huge time saver for developers.\n\nJ2EE stands for ""Java 2 Enterprise Edition"".  \n""Enterprise"" means distributed; this functionality allows you to run a component of your application in Boston and another component in Miami.\nKey features of J2EE include Servlets and Enterprise Java Beans (EJB's)."

3,"Lots of people have trouble with this, so don't feel bad about it.  Let's see if this helps:\n\nSuppose you have to find the LCD of 1/2, 1/5, and 1/8.    What you have to find is the smallest number that you can divide 2, 5, and 8 into.  So let's look at them and see what happens.\n\n2 x 5 = 10, so 10 is the first number we check.  Can you divide all three numbers into 10 evenly?  No, you can't divide 8 into 10, so 10 won't work.  \n\nNow try 2 x 8 = 16, so we check 16.  Can you divide all three numbers into 16?  NO, you can't divide 5 into 16.\n\nNow try 5 x 8 = 40, so we check 40.  Can you divive all three numbers into 40 evenly?  Yes, so most likely 40 is the LCD.  To double check, think about waht other numb ers divide into 40 evenly, for example 2 x 20 = 40.  Is it possible that 20 could be the LCD?  No,  becasue you can't divide 8 into 20 evenly.\n\nSometimes the only nuimber that will work is what you get when you multiply all three numbers together, that is, 2 x 5 x 8 which equals 80, but in this case there is a number smaller than 80 that works.\n\nSo we would have 1/2 = 20/40, 1/5 = 8/40, and 1/8 = 5/40.  I don't know if this makes it any clearer to you, but I hope it helps.  Stick with it.  And ask someone you know to explain it to  you in their way, and you will find a way that makes it stick for you."
3,"Where do you get your information that the settlers were stealing from Indian graves?  And if this is true, you're putting way to bad of a slant on it.

Don't taint our country's history by making the settlers at Plymouth sound like a group of selfish and careless people.  Their first winter was very difficult, and they had to learn how to live all over again.  As for teaching this to elementary students, I think they would be a little young to understand the whole truth.  An older group of students would be able to grasp the details better and know that nothing was malicious in their acts, whatever their acts may have been.  Regardless of the truth, it should be told.  The truth shouldn't be twisted, but made to be understood.  Obviously there are adults out there that can't grasp the meaning behind some things either."

3,"The magic of seven \nSignifies creation, the sum of the spiritual three and the material four \nThe seven ages of man, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins (p 1592), the seven league boot, seventh heaven, the seven wonders of the world, the seven pillars of wisdom, Snow White and the seven dwarves, 7-up.... There are an awful lot of sevens around. Numerologists see seven as the sum of the spiritual three and the material four, signifying creation. The Old Testament tells us that the world was created in seven days. The seventh generation after Adam produced Lamech, who lived for 777 years and was to be avenged 77 fold. Psalm 90 sets the human life span at seven decades. Solomon's temple has seven steps, and Noah's dove returns after seven days. \n\nIn the Hippocratic tradition the number seven governs the ailments of the body. In Germany it was believed that people would not catch swine fever if they spent seven days drinking and bathing in water containing asphodel. A Jewish cure for fever involved taking ""seven prickles from seven palmtrees, seven chips from seven beams, seven nails from seven doors,"" and so on up to ""seven hairs from the beard of an old dog.""1 And in this issue of the BMJ a long but neglected tradition alleging seven year cycles in human development is vindicated in Jos Verhulst and Patrick Onghena's finding of a circaseptennial (roughly seven year) rhythm in the growth of male human ears (p 1597).2 \n\nIn Iranian folklore the cat has seven, not nine, lives and carries her kittens seven times to seven different places.1 ""To do the work of seven mullahs"" means to accomplish absolutely nothing. In ancient India the most important numbers were three and seven. The ancient Indian text Rigveda talks of seven stars and seven streams of soma (the drink of the gods).1 Indra, the rain god, is ""the seven-slayer,"" the ocean has seven depths, and there are seven concentric continents. The sacred cow has 21 names--three times seven. \n\nIn ancient Greece, seven was associated with Athena, the virgin goddess, because it is neither producing nor produced--that is, it has no multiple in the first decade (1-10) and also no divisor (other than 1). The first property has little mathematical importance, but the second tells us that seven is a prime number--having no divisors other than itself and one. It is the second Mersenne prime--one less than a power of two.3 \n\nSeven numbers suffice to colour every map on a torus--a surface shaped like a doughnut with a central hole--so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour. The smallest regular polygon that cannot be constructed using ruler and compasses is the heptagon, with seven sides. All sufficiently large whole numbers are the sum of seven perfect cubes. And it you want to get more esoteric, the unit sphere in a multidimensional space has the greatest surface area when the space has dimension seven. \n\nSeven is an astronomical number. The week has seven days because successive phases of the moon occur roughly seven days apart. Other astronomical sevens include the ""seven sisters,"" the stars of the constellation of the Pleiades, and--in ancient times only--the seven planets: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. In Douglas Adams's The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy the answer to the ""Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything,"" is 42 (six times seven).4 In November 1996 the Independent reported the latest measurements of Hubble's constant--a fundamental physical quantity that determines the rate of growth of our expanding universe.5 ""Dr Richard Saunders,"" the newspaper wrote, ""sounded a trifle abashed by the result. 'We have taken two measurements for the constant, and the average of them is, well, it's 42.'"""

If your child doesn't like the curriculum you have, find something different - there are TONS of options out there.  Good luck!"

3,"Discipline, or more accurately self-discipline, goes hand-in-hand with success.  While there may be exceptions, successful people are typically those who have learned to make themselves do what is needed in order to make things work, to get ahead.  Discipline also makes them do these things in the right way--no cutting corners, no breaking rules.\n\nThe discipline given to children is supposed to help them develop the self-discipline that they will need in order to mature and be successful as adults.\n\nSome children don't receive any discipline; others receive some, but it doesn't ""take.""  Those who reach adulthood without developing discipline will need always to have people around them to motivate them if they are to get anything done.  But, even if they are successful, they will typically also resent those who drive them.\n\nThe satisfaction of self-directed success comes only to the self-disciplined."

3,"I am a special education teacher for children ages 5 to 7,  and I far prefer my job to the job of a school psychologist.  I am the person who has the day to day responsibilities, and also the daily pleasures, of working with these beautiful and entertaining little people.   My students have severe cognitive limitations, but with a supportive learning environment, they all make progress.  And it's a thrill to hear a child who previously didn't speak begin to communicate verbally, or to see a child who previously related to others only in negative ways begin to develop a friendship with another child.  Every day the kids do something that makes all the hard work, and the aggravation, worthwhile.  And they make us laugh each day.  I love my job, my students, and my teaching assistants.  And I have the pleasure both of seeing this wonderful growth and progress each day, and of knowing that I had something to do with making it happen.\n\nAs Mark said previously, in California the psychologists come around infrequently, mainly when they need to do an assessment.  They don't get to have a long-term relationship with the children like the teacher does, and while there is some value to what they do, the truth of it is that the teacher is the one who can make a difference in a child's life and in his or her future.  Testing a kid yields scores, and the psychs write up reports, but that is not helping children in any direct way.\n\nSo I would never trade my job as a special ed teacher with that of a school psychologist."

I write simple one sentence instructions next to each picture. Example: They are to create a craft and write about it.  Put up: pic of pencil and 1.Write your name. Pic of scissors 2. Cut out shapes. Pic of glue 3. Glue shapes to create animal. Pic of Pencil(another)4. Write about your animal.  They can do this independently and it will take them a bit.  \nBe sure to make an incentive for them to complete it or you may lose interest and you'll have chaos. Just having free play is incentive enough.  \nIf you are looking for fun activities:\ncolor or paint by sight words, math problems, etc.\ncreate picture frames from pop-sticks and misc decorations\ncreate own matching game from magazine clippings and index cards\ncreate scrapbook page(s)\nmake model of bedroom using various materials and a shoebox\nmake wordfinds from large squared grid paper\nThese are a few ideas.

First, the viruses may be currently running in memory. It cannot delete files that are running in memory. Second, McAfee is probably the worst antivirus protection you can buy. Sorry to tell you that, but it's true. I recommend Symantec (http://www.symentec.com/) or NOD32 (http://nod32.com and this is the best in the industry).\n\nOne method of removing the viruses  is to start the computer in SAFE Mode. To do this, restart the computer. As soon as the computer starts to boot (i.e. you see a logo screen) press the F8 key repeatedly. Then run your virus scan and see what happens. In SAFE mode, not everything loads, so you should be able to delete some (if not all) of the viruses.\n\nLet me know if that works or if you need more help.

4,"First, the legal issues involved: You own your DVD / CD.  Under fair use laws, you should be able to make a copy of said DVD / CD for backup purposes. However, most DVDs / CDs this day come with some sort of Digital Rights Management (DRM) encoding that acts as a first line of defense, preventing you from copying the disk to your hard drive. Any attempts to break the code of or circumnavigate DRM is considered illegal. Fortunately for us, OS X Panther’s Disk Utility (located in /Applications/Utilities/) is capable of making disk images of most mountable disks, DRM and all. Simply launch Disk Utility, insert the disk you want to copy, select the disk’s mounted name in the sidebar of Disk Utility, and go to Images—>New—>New image from Device (or the mounted name of your disk). (Note: For certain store-bought CDs this no longer works.  Easy work around: rip the CD into iTunes, burn a new copy, then make an image of that copy.  This has the same effect using a loophole and still avoids any unlawful breaking of the DRM.)  Since the DRM is copied, you aren’t technically attempting to break the code, and therefore you aren’t really breaking the law.  Instead you are merely exercising your fair use rights. Now, if you decided to take this information and make a copy for your friend, or start making multiple copies to sell on the streets of Manhattan at $10 a pop, then you are breaking the law.  Don’t do it. (Of course, if you are a criminal, you probably figured your way around all this DRM business long ago, which of course underscores how incredibly silly and inconvenient DRM is for the average law-abiding end user.)\n\nGO here\nhttp://dcdan.com/copy/Copy.html"

You may need a geek friend to assist.  It's technical, but it's not that hard to do.\n\nFor the past 2 day's I have tried just about every solution posted in this forum. I believe I have found a solution that just might work for a large percentage of the viewers. I can't remember whose instructions these were. I copied and pasted and then proceeded as instructed. \n\nStep 1. \nUsing the SubInAcL tool from Microsoft to fix permission issues in the registry has solved installation errors for several products including Flash Player.\nThe following solution involves the Windows System Registry. Editing or manipulating the registry incorrectly can result in serious system damage which may require reinstallation of the operating system. If you are not comfortable editing the registry, then take your system to a professional. If you choose to proceed, then it is essential that you create a complete system backup and a Windows System Restore Point before proceeding. Adobe Systems cannot be held responsible for damage resulting from this information.\n\nYou must have administrator privileges to successfully complete these instructions. \n1. Follow the instructions to download and install the subinacl tool from Microsoft here. \n2. Use a text editor to create a file and name it reset.cmd. Save the reset.cmd in C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Windows Resource Kits&#92;Tools folder. \n3. Copy and paste the following content into the reset.cmd file. Then save and close the file.\n\nsubinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f\nsubinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f\nsubinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f\nsubinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f\n\nsubinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=system=f\nsubinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=system=f\nsubinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=system=f\nsubinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=system=f\n4. Open the command window to run the reset.cmd script. Select Start, Run, and type in ""cmd"". \n5. In the command windows type in ""cd C:&#92;Program Files&#92;Windows Resource Kits&#92;Tools"" and select Enter. \n6. Type in ""reset.cmd"" and select Enter. This will run the SubInACL tool. \n7. After a few minutes processing subinacl, the permissions will be reset. \n8. Install the Flash Player from here: http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer \n9. Test the Flash Player here: http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome \n\n\nNext: STEP 2.\nI took GOLLUX's advice and went to Q313222 from Microsoft and followed this instruction:\n\nTo reset your operating system back to original installation default security settings: 1. Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then press ENTER. \n2. Type secedit /configure /cfg %windir%&#92;repair&#92;secsetup.inf /db secsetup.sdb /verbose, and then press ENTER. You receive a ""Task is completed"" message, and a warning message that something could not be done. You can safely ignore this message. For more information about this message, view the %windir%&#92;Security&#92;Logs&#92;Scesrv.log file. \n\nThanks Gollux & to whoever posted instructions for the Windows Resource Tool.\nProblem solved! \n\nmxmom493"

4,"While the characteristics that one expects of graduates are related to the learning objectives associated with the core units, the expectations one assigns to those who complete an undergraduate degree in computer science reflect a more global level of student achievement. The learning objectives detailed in Appendix A specify what a student must know at the conclusion of any particular unit. In this section, the goal is to identify the characteristics that a successful graduate should possess. At a broad level, these characteristics can be expressed as follows: \n\nSystem-level perspective. The objectives associated with individual units in the body of knowledge tend to emphasize isolated concepts and skills that can lead to a fragmented view of the discipline. Graduates of a computer science program must develop a high-level understanding of systems as a whole. This understanding must transcend the implementation details of the various components to encompass an appreciation for the structure of computer systems and the processes involved in their construction and analysis. \nAppreciation of the interplay between theory and practice. A fundamental aspect of computer science is the balance between theory and practice and the essential link between them. Graduates of a computer science program must understand not only the theoretical underpinnings of the discipline but also how that theory influences practice. \nFamiliarity with common themes. In the course of an undergraduate program in computer science, students will encounter many recurring themes such as abstraction, complexity, and evolutionary change. Graduates should recognize that these themes have broad application to the field of computer science and must not compartmentalize them as relevant only to the domains in which they were introduced. \nSignificant project experience. To ensure that graduates can successfully apply the knowledge they have gained, all students in computer science programs must be involved in at least one substantial software project. Such a project demonstrates the practical application of principles learned in different courses and forces students to integrate material learned at different stages of the curriculum. \nAdaptability. One of the essential characteristics of computer science over its relatively brief history has been an enormous pace of change. Graduates of a computer science program must possess a solid foundation that allows them to maintain their skills as the field evolves. Strategies for achieving this adaptability are described in section 11.3."

4,"Hi there:\nYour question comes up very often on the ANSWERS forum, and\nthere are many answers. Some are very short, some are wrong, and some provide links to other sites -- which can be too short to help, or just badly written...\n Depending on your backgound in mechanical ability, and your age, and your level of patience, I would recommend different things - since I don't know anything about you, I can only advise you to use caution.  I have a teeny website,\nkidbots.com\nabout using old computers for robot controllers. Thus I have hundreds of computers. I also build new ones. There are NO RULES in putting together computers, and there are exceptions to ALL standard parts, and methods,  and aspects of computing, and I have run into most of them. \n\nAll the websites I have seen that explain how to put a computer together, assume that there are only 1 or 2 different kinds of any part, or case, or card, or whatever..... not so. There is not a SINGLE website that even mentions more than one kind of motherboard standoff, and I have dozens of types, so that I wonder about how much experience the authors have. If you happen to buy one of the types that is NOT mentioned, you will be faced with trying to figure out what to do with the parts - and the instructions in the case are either NONE or very badly written ( translated from chinese ) with bad pictures....\n I have dozens of blown up motherboards from thrown out computers, and I see where people have put in brand new motherboards, and put a standoff in the middle of the motherboard -- where there is no hole, and shorted the motherboard and power supply dead, blowing up both. I have new motherboards where the person attached the USB wires onto the motherboard from the front case, and had one set forwards, the other set backwards, and shorted power to ground, blowing up the power supply, and destroying the +5VSB rail motherboard chips. And so on and so on. Tiny little things can blow up a lot of money... All the websites just say "" plug in the wires as marked in the manual "" and half the manuals I have DONT say what the pins are !\n There is VERY little written about the many, many problems one might face in just assembling a computer, with all new, expensive parts.  Any computer shop will have a big pile of blown motherboards and power supplies in a corner.... you can read some of my other answers about power supplies and motherboards....\n\n I would advise you get someone who has built a few comptuers to help you put this one together for the first time - they will point out a few things that you may have missed reading about - and catch problems in time !\n\n Here are a few links with comments, that I scanned over, on building your own computer. Some are better than others, but none really cover all the exceptions and problems that I see others run into in building a PC....\n\n DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Ask as many people as you can about choosing parts BEFORE you buy anything.  AND... get someone there the day you put it together...  \n\nGood Luck !\n\n\nhttp://www.buildyourowncomputer.net/learntobuild.html\n    Glib , no warnings about standoff holes alignment, types\n           no warnings about wires to front panel and USB etc.\n\nhttp://www.buildyourown.org.uk/pc-building/\n     A bit fast, but has pictures of screws, and tells where to\n      use them.

4,"""Script monkey"" is a well-deserved derogatory term for people, usually doing telephone support, that are incapable or unwilling to properly diagnose a problem.  This means they go through a pre-written script of questions, which are essentially put into a flow-chart, and they follow it until it reaches the pre-fabricated reply.  If you're lucky, the people who wrote the script did it well enough that your script monkey was able to able to get you both to the proper conclusion.\n\nBefore I wander too far, it's a somewhat common term.  I doubt it's common in call centers filled with know-nothing ""engineers"" and ""technicians"", but it's common enough with people who have to call the so-called ""technicians"" or ""engineers""."
4,"Do you mean encryption key distribution?  This refers to the fact that you and the person you're communicating with need to exchange key information ahead of time so you can decrypt each others messages.  For example, if we want to communicate by sending encrypted text to each other, we need to communicate ahead of time, such as over the telephone, to agree on a secret key that only the two of us know.  This is the ""key distribution"" happening.  Secure key distribution is usually the biggest issue with private key cryptography because we need some secure way to ecchange the private key ahead of time.  So there are a few options.  First we can exchange the keys physically, like with my telephone example, this is called offline distribution.  Second, we can use public key cryptography to set up an initial connection and exchange keys that way.  But what if we can't use offline and there's no public key infrastructure in place?  Then we can use what is called the Diffie Hellman key exchange.  This allows us to share a private key, securely, over an insecure Internet connection.  The reason it works is advanced math, Diffie Hellman relies on the complexity in finding discrete logarithms.  There's a good example on the Wikipedia site, I will put a link below.  Hope this helps."

4,"You're getting such a variety of answers because we have no idea about your computer budget and your purpose.\n\nnVidia is typically better bang for the buck than ATI, especially in mid-range gfx cards (as the 7x00 GT series). AMD X2 processors will typically be better and cheaper than Intel Pentium 4's (Prescott) and their dual-core counterparts. Currently, AMD X2 4200+ will give you the highest performance/dollar ratio (for both gaming and business-synthetic benchmarks), not to mention that they use less power than Intel CPU's.\n\nBut seriously, you're going to have to tell us a little more about what you're going to do with that PC.

How this has any affect on the overall product, I would doubt it would carry any weight.

However, as a nerd ( :p ) Alienware is quite popular. Dedicated machines for gaming, this would probably be your best bet. The only other option that would ensure perfect gaming is if you build your own computer. However I took the liberty of looking up a good Alienware box with excellent specs and a price under $1,500. The Area-51 5500 comes with an array of respectable features and specs.

Other than that, it's a very decent and affordable system. Hope this helps you out a bit. =)"
4,"try this if it still doesn't work contact yahoo.\nIf Yahoo! Messenger is unable to connect to our servers, one of the following may occur:\nYour software may display a message that says it can't connect.\nThe yellow ""Connecting"" light might last for a long time.\nThe light may stay grey and say ""Not Connected.""\nFirst, check your email or surf web sites to see if you are connected to your ISP (Internet Service Provider). \n\nNext, make sure you have Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 4.1 or above installed on your machine. If you use Netscape as your browser, you don't have to switch to Internet Explorer or even run Explorer. In order to update your system files, you just have to install Internet Explorer. Yahoo! Messenger uses files from Internet Explorer to run. You can download version 5.5 from: \n\n   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.htm \n\nAll of the above conditions indicate a connection problem, not a problem with your Yahoo! ID or password. (If you receive an Invalid Login error message, there is a problem with your ID or password.) \n\nIf you receive a message that says ""You have been logged of as you have logged in on a different machine,"" this means that you have logged onto the Java Messenger while you were running the Windows Messenger, or vice versa. \n\nIf Messenger was able to connect before, but has suddenly stopped, we may be having temporary server problems. These types of problems are usually resolved in a matter of hours.\n\nIf the problem persists, your Messenger connection information may be incorrect. \n\nIf Messenger has never been able to connect, try this: \n\nOpen the Login menu in Messenger. \nClick on Preferences, then click on the Connection tab. \nClick on No network detection, then hit the OK button at the bottom. \nMessenger will ask you if you want to try to log on with your new proxy settings. Click the Yes button. \nWhen prompted, enter your ID and password, then hit the Login button.\nIf that doesn't work, follow these steps:\nOpen the Login menu in Messenger. \nClick on Preferences, then click on the Connection tab. \nClick on Firewall with no proxies, then hit the OK button at the bottom. \nMessenger will ask you if you want to try to log on with your new proxy settings. Click the Yes button. \nWhen prompted, enter your ID and password, then hit the Login button.\nThe above configuration will work in almost any situation. However, if you connect in this way, you won't be able to use the voice chat feature.\n\n\nIf neither of the above options work, you're probably behind a firewall or proxy server that requires you to enter its address. Follow these steps:\n\nOpen the Login menu in Messenger. \nClick on Preferences, then click on the Connection tab. \nClick on Use proxies. Here you can enter your firewall and/or proxy server's address and port number. Contact your network administrator (if you're at work), or your Internet Service Provider (if you're at home) to determine the correct firewall and proxy settings.\nNote: If Messenger crashes and you can't connect, please read our Messenger Crash help section."

Then carefully compare your setting to make sure the computer and router are matched. I've used WPA(PSK) with a lot of success.

This will only allow specific computers that you manually enter into the list. The MAC address can usually be found on the network card and the router will also display it in the connected clients list. Its a hexidecimal number that looks like this:\n02:32:ab:cd:4f:3e\n\nAdd the MAC address for your computer to the ""allowed"" list\n\nThis is easy to do and also works good with older computers such as Windows 98 that don't have good encryption.\n\nOn another note.

It works by looking up the actual locations of remote shares in a table called the Dfs map, in a way very similar to automount mapping in UNIX (see UNIX Automount Mapping in CSE).\n\nThe UNC name for all Dfs files in CSE begins with &#92;&#92;ntdfs&#92;cs.

4,"There could be several reasons for this problem. First it appears that there is some program installed on your system, which loads at the time to booting up of your system causing the system to crash. The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state. However, if by any reason, it is not solving the problem, try starting the system in safe mode. You can do this by hitting F8 key as soon as Windows stops checking memory and immediately before the Windows is loaded. It will give you the options mentioned above. After logging on successfully, you can edit Msconfig file to disable the trouble creating program. The second reason could be a boot sector virus, which is causing this problem. You can also try to boot using a fresh bootable disk and check the system for viruses. Third, this could also be due to the presence of bad sector on your system. You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive. If there are bad sectors on your hard disk, then you can blame this problem on bad sectors (hardware problem) and would need to low-level format your hard disk to wipe off the bad sectors."

4,"The OS is what controls the computer function - Windows is an OS for example.  Every computer has what's called a BIOS chip mounted on the motherboard.  When you boot, the BIOS go through it's series of checks.  It inspects all the circuitry and checks to see what kind of hardware and peripherals are installed on the computer (key board, mouse, printer, scanner, cd, etc) and if the correct drivers are there to operate them.  If anything is out of place it beeps at you and stops.\n\nIf everything checks out it looks at each drive and looks for the first executable file - usually WIN.EXE on the C:, but could be elsewhere depending how your PC is set up.  That's how it knows to boot from the hardrive or floppy or CD.\n\nOnce the OS has been launched, it goes through and checks the registry looking for more executables.  The regisrty is nothing more than a list of system files that's on your computer.  A table of contents of sorts.  When it finds an EXE it launches it.  The more EXE's the longer it takes for you desktop to load.  This is also where spyware gets installed which is why you have a hard time deleting it.  Once it's done you're ready to work.\n\nNow, even though you may not be activley doing something (gaming, surfing, etc) there are still things running in the background.  Your CD-rom, printer, scanner, card readers, etc, are all sitting waiting for a command.  What's going on behind the scenes is the OS is constantly looping - going through that list of executables waiting to see if you have sent something to or from any of those peripherals.  It does this so fast you can't comprehend it.  This is how the computer knows when you've inserted a cd in the drive, have printed a page, inserted a smart card/flash drive, etc.\n\nSpyware/popups are also in this list and it's looking too.  This is why it runs so slow if there is spyware - it's hogging all the resources - your RAM (your internal workspace).  You know how it is when your desk is overloaded and you can't work?  Same thing here.  Spyware sucks up your desk space and other things can't run.  Clean the spyware and it speeds up.\n\nAnyway, the OS keeps track of all of this so you don't have to."

4,"haha i hear for the first time about sodium ram... what i know abt RAM types are:\n\nKinds of RAM\nRAM can be divided into (1) main RAM, which stores every kind of data and makes it quickly accessible to a microprocessor and (2) video RAM, which stores data intended for your display screen, enabling images to get to your display faster. \nMain RAM\nMain RAM can be divided into static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). \n\nStatic RAM (SRAM)\nStatic RAM is more expensive, requires four times the amount of space for a given amount of data than dynamic RAM, but, unlike dynamic RAM, does not need to be power-refreshed and is therefore faster to access. One source gives a typical access time as 25 nanoseconds in contrast to a typical access time of 60 nanoseconds for dynamic RAM. (More recent advances in dynamic RAM have improved access time.) Static RAM is used mainly for the level-1 and level-2 caches that the microprocessor looks in first before looking in dynamic RAM. \nBurst (or SynchBurst) Static RAM (BSRAM)\nBurst SRAM (also known as SynchBurst SRAM) is synchronized with the system clock or, in some cases, the cache bus clock. This allows it be more easily synchronized with any device that accesses it and reduces access waiting time. It is used as the external level-2 cache memory for the Pentium II microprocessor chipset. \nDynamic RAM (DRAM)\nDynamic RAM uses a kind of capacitor that needs frequent power refreshing to retain its charge. Because reading a DRAM discharges its contents, a power refresh is required after each read. Apart from reading, just to maintain the charge that holds its content in place, DRAM must be refreshed about every 15 microseconds. DRAM is the least expensive kind of RAM. \nFast Page Mode DRAM (FPM DRAM)\nPrior to newer forms of DRAM, Fast Page Mode DRAM (FPM DRAM) was the most common kind of DRAM in personal computers. Page mode DRAM essentially accesses a row of RAM without having to continually respecify the row. A row access strobe (RAS) signal is held active while the column access strobe (CAS) signal changes to read a sequence of contiguous cells. This reduces access time and lowers power requirements. Clock timings for FPM DRAM are typically 6-3-3-3 (meaning 3 clock cycles for access setup, and 3 clock cycles for the first and each of three successive accesses based on the initial setup). \nEnhanced DRAM\nEnhanced DRAM (EDRAM) is the combination of SRAM and DRAM in a single package that is usually used for a level-2 cache. Typically, 256 bytes of static RAM is included along with the dynamic RAM. Data is read first from the faster (typically 15 nanoseconds) SRAM and if it is not found there, it is read from the DRAM, typically at 35 nanoseconds. \nExtended Data Output RAM or DRAM (EDO RAM or EDO DRAM)\nExtended Data Output RAM (EDO RAM) or Extended Data Output Dynamic RAM (EDO DRAM) is up to 25% faster than standard DRAM and reduces the need for level-2 cache memory. \nBurst Extended Data Output DRAM (BEDO DRAM)\nBEDO DRAM improves page mode DRAM by ""building in"" three successive column address shifts after the first column address is specified so that four bits are read as a burst. Together with a dual-bank architecture, BEDO DRAM promised to offer 4-1-1-1 access times. However, because Intel and other manufacturers preferred SDRAM, BEDO DRAM was not widely used. \nNonvolatile RAM (NVRAM)\nNonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) is a special kind of RAM that retains data when the computer is turned off or there is a power failure. Like the computer's read-only memory (ROM), it is powered by a battery within the computer. It can also work by writing its contents to and restoring them from an EEPROM. \nSynchronous DRAM (SDRAM)\nSynchronous DRAM (SDRAM) is a generic name for various kinds of DRAM that are synchronized with the clock speed that the microprocessor is optimized for. This tends to increase the number of instructions that the processor can perform in a given time. The speed of SDRAM"

4,"The canonical way to earn money from open source is to offer customization and support. You provide the software as-is for free, and offer value-added materials like manuals, training, and custom modifications for a price. The theory is that once written, the code has no marginal cost, but the other products and services do.\n\nThe most common open-source license is GNU, and you can legally repackage and resell any code released under the GNU license provided you make the full source code available and release it under the same license -- which means that you have no recourse if someone else takes your distribution, repackages it, and redistributes it at a slightly lower price. Really, the place to make money is in customization and other consulting work, not from the software itself."

4,"To ensure long-term battery vitality, do the following: When first using your laptop on battery power, let the battery completely drain before you recharge it. Don't recharge when the battery is only half drained. Do that for at least the first two sessions. Also, follow this practice once every month.\n\nIf you primarily use your computer with the AC adapter attached and only infrequently use battery power, you can increase the lifespan of the battery by changing the charge thresholds. This feature is available in most Laptops. This allows you to reduce the number of charge cycles by letting the battery discharge to a lower percentage before beginning to recharge. It also allows you to set the maximum charge value to below 100%. This is useful because batteries which are used infrequently have a longer lifespan when they are stored at less than full charge.\n\nThis was the specific answer to your question.

4,"A transistor laser is a solid-state device (i.e., fabricated in much the same way as computer chips) that emits coherent light--that is, light with essentially a single wavelength (a ""pure"" color) in which all of the wave crests are aligned.  This differs from light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are somewhat simpler solid-state devices that emit a range of wavelengths and do so in many directions at once.  Unlike traditional, bulky lasers, a transistor laser can be mass-manufactured very cheaply, and it can provide a natural bridge between electronic components and optical ones (e.g., fiber-optic networks).\n\nBecause the wave crests in laser light are all aligned, there is essentially no destructive interference between different light waves, so this form of light is very efficient in terms of power requirements and transmission distance.  That's why lasers are used in optical networking (especially telephony and long-haul Internet backbones) and also why it's dangerous to stare at one (the light energy is transferred to your retina so efficiently that it can destroy the cells)."

4,"Lasers are usually faster, produce somewhat better text and cost less per page, but they are a bit more expensive to buy and are normally black and white only.  (Color lasers are prohibitively costly for home/small office use.)\n\nInkjets, while slower, are better for images and can do things like color charts that cannot be done on a black and white laser.  They cost almost nothing to buy these days (a low-priced inkjet often costs little more than the ink cartridges that come with it).  But the ink is much more expensive than toner for lasers, because it does not last nearly as long.\n\nOne more thing:  inkjet ink will clog if the printer is not used regularly (say, every few days).  That is extremely wasteful of ink and greatly increases the net operating cost.  If your printer may sit idle for weeks at a time, you will find a laser far more cost-effective.\nGood luck!!"

4,"The Import and Export Wizard in Outlook makes it easy to export contact information from Outlook into an Excel worksheet (worksheet: The primary document that you use in Excel to store and work with data. Also called a spreadsheet. A worksheet consists of cells that are organized into columns and rows; a worksheet is always stored in a workbook.). \n\nNote  Before you use the wizard, it helps to understand the difference between the Outlook Address Book (Address Book: The collection of address books that you can use to store names, e-mail addresses, fax numbers, and distribution lists. The Address Book may contain a Global Address List, an Outlook Address Book, and a Personal Address Book.) and Outlook Contacts. Both are part of Outlook. However, the Address Book is a compilation of the different address lists you might have stored in Outlook, such as a Personal Address Book (.pab), LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): A protocol that provides access to Internet Directories.) Internet directories, the Global Address List (GAL) (Global Address List: The address book that contains all user, group, and distribution list e-mail addresses in your organization. The administrator creates and maintains this address book. It may also contain public folder e-mail addresses.), or other third-party address books. Contacts is just one of the address lists that make up the Address Book.

The cells in a range can be adjacent or nonadjacent.) for field names.

4,"Typically, e-mail is only encrypted if it contains information you wouldn't want to disclose to anyone who might be able to see it as it's being transported to the recipient. E-mail, in general, is all plain text and can be read by system administrators operating the e-mail servers or anyone who is able to ""sniff"" the network either you or the servers are located on. \n\nA popular way of encrypting e-mail messages is to use a public key cryptography application such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). Despite the name, it's actually very good encryption. A public key cryptographic system allows you to have two ""keys"", which are really just files containing a string of characters. Your public key is stored on a key server and your private key is kept on your local PC and should NEVER be given to anyone. The recipient will need PGP as well to encrypt/decrypt any messages. When you send them a message you wish to be private, you encrypt that message with the recipient's public key. Since they are the only one who should have their private key, they are the only one who will be able to decrypt and read the message. If someone wants to send you a private message, they would encrypt the message with your public key and you would decrypt it once it is received, with your private key.\n\nOther Info:\nPGP Free Edition:http://www.pgpi.org/products/pgp/versions/freeware/\nPGP FAQs:\nhttp://www.pgpi.org/doc/faq/"
4,"The .ape extension belongs to Monkey's Audio. Monkey’s Audio is a fast and easy way to compress digital music.  Unlike traditional methods such as mp3, ogg, or lqt that permanently discard quality to save space, Monkey’s Audio only makes perfect, bit-for-bit copies of your music.  That means it always sounds perfect  – exactly the same as the original.  Even though the sound is perfect, it still saves a lot of space. (think of it as a beefed-up Winzip™ for your music) The other great thing is that you can always decompress your Monkey's Audio files back to the exact, original files.  That way, you'll never have to recopy your CD collection to switch formats, and you'll always be able to recreate the original music CD if something ever happens to yours."

4,"Neither!  So many people here seem to like Symantec and McAfee and the deplorable Norton Internet Security which will slow your system down worse than all the viruses and spyware in the world would.\n\nFirst, Anti-Virus, AVG Free Edition (http://free.girsoft.com/ ), regardless of the fact that it is free it is one of THE BEST anti-virus applications on the market, period.  They also have enterprise edition software too that corporations have to pay for which is why they can give away the Home Edition.\n\nFor a Firewall (always have your PC behind a router) but for a software solution I like the Kerio Personal Firewall, http://www.snapfiles.com/get/keriofirewall.html\n\nFor spyware protection get all of the following:\n\nAdaware SE Personal, http://www.lavasoft.com/\nMS Antispyware Beta, http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx\nSpybot S&D, http://www.safer-networking.com/\nSpywareBlaster, http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/\n\nNow with all those applications your computer is probably protected better than any running Symantec or McAfee and you didn't pay a cent."

It started acting funny, and after I cleaned it, it seemed to work fine.\n\nDefinitely try that if you have never cleaned out its insides before.

4,"get your music and do the following to make a playlist.\n\nYou can easily make a playlist in Windows Notepad. BE SURE TO PRESS ENTER AFTER EACH URL EXCEPT THE LAST ONE. then save it as playlist.m3u\n\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/song1.mp3\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/song2.mp3\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/song3.mp3\n\nNow you go here and use this free web-based tool to make the HTML/XHTML source code for you. When it asks you for a width and height type in zero so the controls and video viewing area do not show on your page.\n\nhttp://cit.ucsf.edu/embedmedia/step1.php\n\nWhen it asks for the filename just type in playlist.m3u\n\nYou can take that even farther like below.\n\nLet's say you have several of these playlists with various songs in them. You can make a master playlist that will play all of them. Just repeat what I did above in Notepad. BE SURE TO PRESS ENTER AFTER EACH URL EXCEPT THE LAST ONE. \n\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/playlist1.m3u\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/playlist2.m3u\nhttp://www.yourdomain.com/playlist3.m3u\n\nNow save that as masterplaylist.m3u you can even mix playlists together. Some with videos and somE with just music. IF YOU ARE USING THIS AS BACKGROUND MUSIC DO NOT USE VIDEO PLAYLISTS!\n\nThese techniques work with all multimedia filetypes such as wav, midi, au, mp3, asx, asf, swf, mpeg, mov etc.\n\nI have one playlist with 2100 songs in it. Maybe one of these days I'll finally get to the end of it :lol:\n\nDo not link to music/video files on other people's site without their permission. It will eat up all their data transfer and then they won't be able to listen to their own music. You wouldn't like it if they did it to you. Instead upload the music to your own site or to a free multimedia host like http://www.supload.com/ and link to them there. Try to avoid these if you can. If there server is down for maintenance or for some other reason the files won't play on your site.\n\nNOTE: You don't have to save these as playlist or masterplaylist. I just used those names because they best described what I was talking about. You can call them ""bumperthumpers"" if you want to. I don't care. :)\n\nThis same method works for videos\n\nNow that you have a playlist click on the LOK AND FEEL link in the left menu on xanga and scroll down the page to ""MUSIC"". Paste URL in there and set it to loop your music. Now all of your songs will play one after the other till they are all done.\n\nI have about 100 in mine.\n\nhttp://www.xanga.com/cssiscool/"

They even guess random email addresses that turn out to be real. \n\nIf you click on the links in their emails and reply them, it alerts them about the authenticity of your email address. As a result, they send your email address to fellow spammers who send you more emails. It's basically a chain of spammers. \n\nInternet is not that private as we think.

4,"A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, is a private communications network usually used within a company, or by several different companies or organizations, to communicate over a public network. VPN message traffic is carried on public networking infrastructure (e.g. the Internet) using standard (often insecure) protocols, or over a service provider's network providing VPN service guarded by well defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider.\n\nAuthentication mechanism\nVPN involves two parts: the protected or ""inside"" network that provides physical security and administrative security sufficing to protect transmission (sometimes it is not always the case), and a less trustworthy or ""outside"" network or segment (the internet is the biggest ""jungle""). Generally, a firewall sits between a remote user's workstation or client and the host network or server. As the user's client establishes the communication with the firewall, the client may pass authentication data to an authentication service inside the perimeter. A known trusted person, sometimes only when using trusted devices, can be provided with appropriate security privileges to access resources not available to general users.\n\nMany VPN client programs can be configured to require that all IP traffic must pass through the tunnel while the VPN is active, for better security. From the user's perspective, this means that while the VPN client is active, all access outside their employer's secure network must pass through the same firewall as would be the case while physically connected to the office ethernet. This reduces the risk that an attacker might gain access to the secured network by attacking the employee's laptop: to other computers on the employee's home network, or on the public internet, it is as though the machine running the VPN client simply does not exist. Such security is important because other computers local to the network on which the client computer is operating may be untrusted or partially trusted. Even with a home network that is protected from the outside internet by a firewall, people who share a home may be simultaneously working for different employers over their respective VPN connections from the shared home network. Each employer would therefore want to ensure their proprietary data is kept secure, even if another computer in the local network gets infected with malware. And if a travelling employee uses a VPN client from a Wi-Fi access point in a public place, such security is even more important. However, the use of IPX/SPX is one way users might still be able to access local resources.\n\nTypes of VPNs\nSecure VPNs (SVPNs) use cryptographic tunneling protocols to provide the necessary confidentiality (preventing snooping), sender authentication (preventing identity spoofing), and message integrity (preventing message alteration) to achieve the privacy intended. When properly chosen, implemented, and used, such techniques can provide secure communications over unsecured networks.\n\nBecause such choice, implementation, and use are not trivial, there are many insecure VPN schemes on the market.\n\nSecure VPN technologies may also be used to enhance security as a ""security overlay"" within dedicated networking infrastructures.\n\nSecure VPN protocols include the following:\n\nIPsec (IP security), an obligatory part of IPv6. \nSSL used either for tunneling the entire network stack, such as in OpenVPN, or for securing what is essentially a web proxy. Although the latter is often called a ""SSL VPN"" by VPN vendors, it is not really a fully-fledged VPN. (See also TUN/TAP.) \nPPTP (point-to-point tunneling protocol), developed jointly by a number of companies, including Microsoft. \nSome large ISPs now offer ""managed"" VPN service for business customers who want the security and convenience of a VPN but prefer not to under"

The system is backed by a relational database that retains all changes made to a project during its evolution. IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle database are supported database servers.\n\nStarTeam supports branching and 3-way merging, difference analysis, advanced user access and security management, checkpoints, end user and administrator auditing, and customization features. The server is designed for distributed use and supports strong encryption for remote connections. StarTeam allows ""live"" backups while the server is in active use and includes an optional publish/subscribe event system called StarTeam MPX to enhance scalability. However, it does not provide atomic commits; versioning is performed on individual files.\n\nIn addition to file versioning, StarTeam also stores requirements, project tasks, change requests, and discussions. All of these can be interlinked to enhance traceability within a project.\n\nStarTeam includes a number of clients, including native Windows, a web client, a cross-platform Java client, a command line interface, Windows Explorer integration, and integrations for popular Integrated development environments such as Borland Delphi. StarTeam includes several APIs for platforms including COM, Java, and the Microsoft .NET Framework. It also provides a compliant SCC API for integration with IDEs that offer integrated revision control features."
4,"Is it one hard drive to two or two hard drives?\n\nI assume you meant ""partition a hard drive to two""... Partitioning is a good idea especially when you have to reinstall an operating system. I usually partition the hard disk and keep my data in D: whereas I keep my OS and the program files in C:. This way, I can reinstall the OS without loosing my data.\n\nThe procedure depends on whether you have to preserve the data in the current drive or not. If you don't need to then you can download the Ranish Partition Manager and partition it refering to the help. With some effor you may be able to do it with FDISK also.\nRanish Partition Manager:\nhttp://www.ranish.com/part/\n\nIf you have to preserve the data currently on disk then it is very difficult. I have done it with Ranish Partition Manager but you need to be an expert. The best way may be to buy one of the popular partition tools. Those tools can partition, resize, move partitions without loosing data. These are my recommendations:\nPartition Magic: http://www.powerquest.com/home_homeoffice/products/system_performance/pm80/index.html\nAcronis disk director:\nhttp://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/diskdirector/partitioning.html\n7 tools partition manager:\nhttp://www.7tools.com/\nVCOM partition commander:\nhttp://www.v-com.com/product/Partition_Commander_Home.html"

Refer http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/install-guide/ch-x86-dualboot.html\n\nWhile partitioning, dont allow it to do autopartition, as it would eat up all the free space u have.. Choose ""Manual Partition with diskdruid"" option and partition it as follows..\n\nYou may assign some 10GB for linux, where the partitioning may be as follows:\n\nMount Point   -----          Size\n------------------------------\n/        ------         5GB\n/home    ------         5GB\n/boot    ------         100MB\nSWAP     ------  3 x RAM_SIZE if ur RAM is less than 512MB if RAM is >512 MB, have ur SWAP as 750MB (This is my personal opinion after a lot of performance testing and optimization)\n\nYou can mount your FAT or NTFS format drives(windows drives) with linux.. so, u dont neeed to assign much extra space to linux, as ext3(linux format) drives cant be seen from windows. You can instead use the mounted windows drives itself for data storage on linux also. This way you can have the maximum amount of hard disk usable on both OSes.\n\nTo start with, Mandriva or Fedora should be good options, as regards to distro.\n\nHope this helps you in installing a dual boot system succesfully.\n\n(PS: Remember that installing Windows XP first and then installing linux is the easiest way, as linux would detect windows and boot it, whereas windows wont detect linux. Though there are other ways to recover linux partition if u install linux before installing windows, its not the recommended way for a newbie)"

4,"Instead of using windows update, you will need to go to microsoft's download pages, so that you can download files to your hard drive.  You may need your friend's windows key to certify it genuine.  If that fails, bring your friend's computer to your house and do it that way, might be simpler."
4,"To do this you need a special piece of equipment called a scanner.  The scanner will convert any picture on paper into a computer image.  If you don't have a scanner, you still might be able to use a scanner at a friend's house or in a public area, and then put the file on a disk, upload it to a website, or e-mail it to yourself.\n\nYou might try looking in a school library for a scanner.  Ask around...if you're friends with the secretary in any office, ask them if there is a scanner you could use.  A public library or college library may also have a scanner you could use.\n\nAnother good option for getting an image from paper onto the computer is a digital camera.  Especially compared to older scanners, newer cameras often will get just as good an image--the only problem is that it can be difficult to set up the lighting correctly and getting the shot so that it is square and not out of proportion.  If you can't find a scanner, finding a digital camera might be your next best bet.\n\nGood luck."

To do this, run a 10 foot cable to a hub (make sure the hub is the kind that plugs into an electrical outlet) and then plug the device into the hub.

4,"A copy constructor for a class is a constructor that has an object of the class as its only parameter. It makes a new object that is a duplicate of the original object.\n\nOperator overloading is defining new meaning for existing operators. For example, string classes usually overload the arithmetic ""+"" operation to mean string concatenation.\n\nA pointer is a variable that holds the address of another variable.\n\nA reference is another name for an existing object. If you have an object A, and you create an object B, which is a reference to A, when you modify B, you are actually modifying A.  \n\nWhen you have a subroutine, and you pass it a variable as a parameter, what the subroutine gets is a copy of the original value. If you changed the parameter in the subroutine, it does nothing to the original variables value.\nIf, however, you pass a reference to the variable, then any changes you make to the parameter in the subroutine are made to the original value."

You don't have to delete any e-mail and you can quickly search through all of your archived mail.  They have a very good spam filter.  The text ads are very unobstructive.  And the best thing is that they are always improving this great service!

4,"This program is the Adobe Acrobat speed launcher. Strictly speaking it is not required. \n\nCouple of suggestions:\n\n1) reboot your machine and see if the problem clears, it could be a temporary memory / address space error. If rebooting does not fix it ...\n2) Terminate the application, then run msconfig [ Start / Run / msconfig ], select the Startup tab, locate the reader_sl.exe and uncheck the box then press OK. (You may want to select the option not to be reminded again of this change.)  \n\nAlso, check the Start / Programs / Startup folder for this program (the display name may be different than reader_sl.exe). If you see it there, point at the file (shortcut actually), right-click it, and choose delete. (You could also cut it, then paste it into another folder temporarily if you think you might want to put it back. In either case you are deleting or moving the shortcut to the file, not the original file.)\n\nIf that STILL doesn't fix the problem, or it recurs, refer to these instructions at http://www.file.net/process/reader_sl.exe.html or search for a similar procedure.

4,"If your screen showed up white on your laptop then it's not the backlight.  Your screen would be very dark and pretty much impossible to read without a backlight.  Since you tried another monitor and had the same result, or at least that's how I understand it, it sounds like it's a graphics issue.  It's possible that the shock of slamming the lid shut has caused damage to your motherboard.\n\nIf in fact you could see everything when you used a monitor, you very well could have broken a contact on your motherboard, broken a cable, or something entirely more fun than either of these.  You could break out the multimeter and check contacts, but that may prove to be quite tedious.  It seems like your problem is directly linked to the connection of the LCD.  Poke around a bit and see if a ribbon cable isn't seated properly or something else.  I'm not familiar with Dell's method of routing the video signal from the mobo to the screen.  Good luck."

I don't know if there are any out-of-the-box sites you can start up for $100.  The bottom line is that you need content.  You can probably get the site for $100, but I doubt you can get the content.  \n\nTo get decent content to compete in the worlds porn market, you'll need to do a little more than sneak a camera into your big sister's bathroom.\n\nThe other problem is Internet bandwidth.   If you have a lot of users downloading lots of images and video's, I doubt your $100 site builder fee will cover that.  I only know this because at one time, my company shared a massive internet connection with a porn site and as they gained in popularity, our internet connection would slow to a crawl.  Evenetually, they had to purchase extra bandwidth on their own connection (very expensive).\n\nAt any rate, starting a porn site is like starting any other site.  You have to build a better mouse trap than the next guy and if you don't even know how to start a website, it's unlikly you have the skills to pull the rest of it together (no offense).

But Windows XP is going to be just a few more things better.

4,"Yes as good as rambus is it will never gain a significant market share. The lisencing scheme makes it more expensive to produce and sell RD-RAM. The other factor is limited production. RD-RAM doesn't sell as many units as DDR sells so less of it is produced. There are also less companies who make rambus due to the royalties(less competition).\n\nAlso the problem might lie with distributors being negatively biased. I bought a PC in 2001 with 256 MB rambus ram within two years the price almost doubled, and then no one in RSA even bothered to put it on their pricelist becuase nobody was buying. Still now none of my suppliers here in RSA sell rambus, because there is only a small portion of people who can afford  computers, and an even smaller portion who can afford such the luxury of Rd-Ram.\n\nSony had the forsight to put rambus in PS2 and PS3 will use rambus as well, which once again means it will be more expensive than consoles running on DDR/2."

If you want links to other websites (not your own) have them ready to be copy and pasted to.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of work (AND IT IS!) but the more time you spend organizing and getting everything ready to go before you get into actually creating your website, the faster and easier it will be.\n\nNext...find a free service like Geocities.

When you get a free geocities page, you can just pick webpage templates that are already designed so you really don't need to know html.  Just fill out your preferences, upload your photos and paste your links, copy and paste your info and voila!  You have a one page webpage.\n\nTo add more pages you should learn a little html.  Like how to add a link.  < a href="" http://www.geocities.com/  {the name of your new page} .html "" >Click Here Stuff < /a>  (no spaces though).  Then name your new page to match.  Usually don't add a link to your main page until you have a 2nd page created...you get the idea.  Geocities has html basic help for this as well.\n\nGood luck and have fun!"

4,"It is possible to burn video to what you call an ""audio"" cd, in which case it would be called a video cd instead. You simply need to format the video correctly, which usually involves compressing the video into 1 of 2 common sizes, called ""Video CD"" or ""Super Video CD"". Then, you have to format the disc correctly so that it can be played in a DVD player, provided the player can in fact play (Super) Video CDs (most can).\n\nThere are many programs available that make this a simple task. Perhaps the most widely used is Nero, which usually comes free with most CD and DVD burners. Also, a good alternative to Nero (at least in my opinion) is dvdSanta:\n\nhttp://www.dvdsanta.com/\n\nHowever, in your above question, you mentioned that you have a DVD-ROM drive. If that's the case, then the above programs won't work because you can't write any type of data to a disc using just a DVD-ROM drive. CD-ROM and DVD-ROM are just for reading CDs and DVDs. What you need is a DVD WRITER, or BURNER. If your computer does not have one built in, then you can buy an external one. CD writers are generally less expensive than DVD writers, but can only burn CDs. DVD writers are more costly, but can burn DVDs and CDs. A DVD writer is usually the way to go, especially when you want to burn video, because it will hold more video, the video will be higher quality, and DVDs can be played in more DVD players than CDs can."

4,"In computer networking and telecommunications, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a data-carrying mechanism which emulates some properties of a circuit-switched network over a packet-switched network. MPLS operates at a OSI Model layer that is generally considered to lie between traditional definitions of Layer 2 (data link layer) and Layer 3 (network layer), and thus is often referred to as a ""Layer 2.5"" protocol. It was designed to provide a unified data-carrying service for both circuit-based clients and packet-switching clients which provide a datagram service model. It can be used to carry many different kinds of traffic, including IP packets, as well as native ATM, SONET, and Ethernet frames.\n\nBackground\nA number of different technologies were previously deployed with essentially identical goals, such as frame relay and ATM. MPLS is now replacing these technologies in the marketplace, mostly because it is better aligned with current and future technology and needs.\n\nIn particular, MPLS dispenses with the cell-switching and signalling-protocol baggage of ATM. MPLS recognizes that small ATM cells are not needed in the core of modern networks, since modern optical networks (as of 2001) are so fast (at 10 Gbit/s and well beyond) that even full-length 1500 byte packets do not incur significant real-time queuing delays (the need to reduce such delays, to support voice traffic, having been the motivation for the cell nature of ATM).\n\nAt the same time, it attempts to preserve the traffic engineering and out-of-band control that made frame relay and ATM attractive for deploying large scale networks.\n\nMPLS was originally proposed by a group of engineers from Cisco Systems, Inc.; it was called ""Tag Switching"" when it was a Cisco proprietary proposal, and was renamed ""Label Switching"" when it was handed over to the IETF for open standardization.\n\nOne original motivation was to allow the creation of simple high-speed switches, since it was at one point thought to be impossible to forward IP packets entirely in hardware. However, advances in VLSI have made such devices possible. The systemic advantages of MPLS, such as the ability to support multiple service models, do traffic management, etc, remain.\n\nHow MPLS works\nMPLS works by prepending packets with an MPLS header, containing one or more 'labels'. This is called a label stack.\n\nEach label stack entry contains four fields:\n\na 20-bit label value. \na 3-bit experimental field reserved for future use. \na 1-bit bottom of stack flag. If this is set, it signifies the current label is the last in the stack. \nan 8-bit TTL (time to live) field. \nThese MPLS labeled packets are forwarded (switched is the correct term) after a Label Lookup/Switch instead of a lookup into the IP table. Label Lookup and Label Switching may be faster than usual RIB lookup because it can take place directly into fabric and not CPU.\n\nThe exit points of an MPLS network are called Label Edge Routers (LER). Routers that are performing routing based only on Label Switching are called Label Switch Routers (LSR). Remember that a LER is not usually the one that is popping the label. For more information see Penultimate Hop Popping.\n\nDevices that function as ingress and/or egress routers are often called PE (Provider Edge) routers. Devices that function only as transit routers are similarly called P (Provider) routers. The job of a P router is significantly easier than that of a PE router, so they can be less complex and may be more dependable because of this.\n\nWhen an unlabeled packet enters the ingress router and needs to be passed on to an MPLS tunnel, the router first determines the forwarding equivalence class the packet should be in, and then inserts one (or more) labels in the packet's newly created MPLS header. The packet is then passed on to the next hop router for this tunnel.\n\nWhen a labeled packet is received by an MPLS router, the top"

4,"Wi-Fi doesn't stand for anything.\n\nIt is not an acronym. There is no meaning.\n\nWi-Fi and the ying yang style logo were invented by Interbrand. We (the founding members of the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, now called the Wi-Fi Alliance) hired Interbrand to come up with the name and logo that we could use for our interoperability seal and marketing efforts. We needed something that was a little catchier than ""IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence"". Interbrand created ""Prozac"", ""Compaq"" ""oneworld"", ""Imation"" and many other brand names that you have heard of. They even created the company name ""Vivato"".\n\nThe only reason that you hear anything about ""Wireless Fidelity"" is some of my colleagues in the group were afraid. They didn't understand branding or marketing. They could not imagine using the name ""Wi-Fi"" without having some sort of literal explanation. So we compromised and agreed to include the tag line ""The Standard for Wireless Fidelity"" along with the name. This was a mistake and only served to confuse people and dilute the brand. For the first year or so( circa 2000) , this would appear in all of our communications. I still have a hat and a couple of golf shirts with the tag line. Later, when Wi-Fi was becoming more successful and we got some marketing and business people from larger companies on the board, the alliance dropped the tag-line.\n\nThis tag line was invented after the fact. After we chose the name Wi-Fi from a list of 10 names that Interbrand proposed. The tag line was invented by the initial six member board and it does not mean anything either. If you decompose the tag line, it falls apart very quickly. ""The Standard""? The Wi-Fi Alliance has always been very careful to stay out of inventing standards. The standard of interest is IEEE 802.11. The Wi-Fi Alliance focuses on interoperability certification and branding. It does not invent standards. It does not compete with IEEE. It complements their efforts. So Wi-Fi could never be a standard. And ""Wireless Fidelity"" - what does that mean? Nothing. It was a clumsy attempt to come up with two words that matched Wi and Fi. That's it.\n\nSo we were smart to hire Interbrand to come up with the name and logo. We were dumb to confuse and water down their efforts by adding the meaningless tag line. Please help reinforce the good work that we did and forget the tag line. \n\nMore info here...\nhttp://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/08/wifi_isnt_short_for_.html"

With this you need to go to your local Cingular, Sprint, or Verizon Wireless store to check the prices on PC Cards. Try to go with the company that your cell phone is carried by, because usually the carrier will offer discounts if you are a subscriber with some other plan. \nMy relatives have a Sprint broadband card. At full service, the speed is 115kb/sec, which is much faster than dial-up, and slightly slower than dsl, but it's still fast, good for what you're doing (emails). \n\nWhat you need:\n\n1. Between $60-90/month (Verizon is $60 if you have phone service with them already and 80 if you don't).\n2. A PC Card (bought online or at a local wireless carrier store.\n3.

5,"First of all, the Argentinians were playing rough from the word 'go'. Secondly, it was Cruz who started provoking the German players during penalties, by showing them the middle finger, every time an Argentinian scored. Then, when Borowski returned the gesture after HE scored his, they did not like it. So after the winning penalty, as the Germans were trying to celebrate, Cufre chased after Mertesacker - confusing him with the equally tall and blond Burowski - and kicked him very hard. As soon as this happened, a whole group of Argentinians surrounded some German players and officials. Rodriguez jumped into the crowd and started punching. In the meantime, Bierhoff, trying to intervene, got chased, insulted and kicked by Ayala and Heinze. \nObviously the Argentinians were gutted to be out, and understandibly, as they had been the best team in the tournament and favourites to go all the way. BUT, that's no excuse to behave like this! Burowski should not have let them provoke him, but he didn't deserve that kind of reaction (and neither did poor Mertesacker!). \nAt the end of the day, Germany won fairly - no one wants to have to decide a game with a penalty shoot out, but there you go. Germany have been consistently good throughout the whole tournament, as have Argentina. Germany simply had luck on their side last night. And Lehmann."

5,"ive been playing for 3 years, and have competed in 3 tournaments and i think 4 scenario games.\n\nmy suggestion to you is that once you hear the distinct *pop pop pop* of another paintball gun (weather it be your teams or not) keep your head down and find some cover. once you're there try and scope out where your enimies are by listening to the shots and peeking out when theres moments of silence. if all they do is shoot the bunker you're behind then let them - it saves your energy and wastes their paint ;).\n\nmy favorite thing to do it be unpredictable. when i play i try and move as fast as i can and whenever i get a chance, like if i hear silence for more then 1 1/2 seconds ill move up to the next bunker and wait for another oppertuity. this makes for some good close range shooting and catching your enimies off guard.\n\nwhat you do NOT want to do is stay in one spot forever. this is a deathtrap, and you will be shot out eventually. the second best no no you can do is being afraid of being shot, when you get scared, you get anxious, and you loose your control over aim, vision, movement etc. i find that the best times to shoot is after you have found some cover, take some deep breaths, put the tank of the gun (CO2 or Compressed air) to your shoulder like the butt of a gun, take some deep breaths, and slowly look out and keep your gun aimed at what you're looking at. \n\nbasically, you want to keep your head down at all times, KEEP MOVING, dont be afraid of the paintballs, and be fast - do not hesitate - or your enimies will catch that hesitation and act on it!\n\nGOOD LUCK! and HAVE FUN!"

I suggest finding someone who can shoot the ""perfect"" jump shot over and over while someone video tapes the vital body positions and movements. Then have the ""amateur"" mirror the video while you video tape him/her... review the clips and make suggestions on what adjustments they need. Seeing it for themselves will help immensely. Put it on a tape they can review at home till they achieve a good sense of modeling the proper body movements to achieve success in jump shots. It's a matter of creating muscle memory so this person can make jump shots in their sleep. That will take time, be patient with the amateur. They won't be able to adjust their movements till they can actually see and feel what the proper movements are even though someone may be telling them the proper technique.

5,"Turbochargers are a type of forced induction system. They compress the air flowing into the engine. The advantage of compressing the air is that it lets the engine squeeze more air into a cylinder, and more air means that more fuel can be added. Therefore, you get more power from each explosion in each cylinder. A turbocharged engine produces more power overall than the same engine without the charging. This can significantly improve the power-to-weight ratio for the engine. \nIn order to achieve this boost, the turbocharger uses the exhaust flow from the engine to spin a turbine, which in turn spins an air pump. The turbine in the turbocharger spins at speeds of up to 150,000 rotations per minute (rpm) -- that's about 30 times faster than most car engines can go. And since it is hooked up to the exhaust, the temperatures in the turbine are also very high.\n\ni sugest to you to read my source"

5,"I agree with GOD'S answer, except that it mentions a pool. If you do not have a pool, you would be unable to complete some of the exercises.\n\nWhen I was on X-Country, I built up a ton of stamina. At the beginning it was difficult for me to run one mile. Near the end, I could run 5 or 6 miles easily.\n\nFirst thing we did every day was stretch out, to make sure we wouldn't strain/pull a muscle. We then did various running exercises. We did high knees, where you bring your knees up to your chest as you run. Skywalkers, where you tilt your head back as far as you can while running, trying to maintain your balance. We also did an exercise called breakdance; its hard to explain, but I will try. You are going sideways... put your left foot in front, pull your right foot back over, put your left foot in back, pull your right foot back over. I know this is hard to understand, but hopefully you will realize what I mean. We would also do leg kicks, where you kick out your legs while running. Another good exercise is called BUTTKICKS. While running, bring your feet back high so the literally kick your butt. Just remember not to kick too hard... ""OUCH!"" We would then do some short sprints and some long distance running. \n\nRemember, start SLOW. Don't try and run 10 miles the first day. Start off with a 1/2 a mile. Each week, add another 1/2 mile. Soon, you will be running 5, 7, even 10 miles! If at any point you are having difficulty with a distance, go back 1/2 a mile. The important thing is to not overwork yourself. If you try to hard, you may seriously risk your health. Also, remember to stay hydrated. Water is the most important thing for a working body. If you are not fully hydrated at all times, your body will not perform at your best.\n\nAnother thing to remember is this, eat a banana 2 days and the day before your game. Banana's are loaded with carbohydrates, to give you the energy your body needs and prevents cramping. Also, don't eat a chocolate bar or anything else sugary. Although the sugar gives you a quick, short boost, it drains you of energy after a few minutes. Try having some grapes, or maybe a granola bar. Remember, eating to much gives you cramps."

5,"The need for a single body to oversee the worldwide game became apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to seven other European countries to band together to form this association. FIFA was founded in Paris on May 21, 1904 - the French name and acronym persist to this day, even in English-speaking countries. Its first president was Robert Guérin.\n\nFIFA presided over its first international competition in 1906, however it met with little approval or success. This, in combination with economic factors, led to the swift replacement of Guérin with Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by now a member association. The next tournament staged, the football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912 and the United States in 1913.\n\nFIFA however floundered during World War I with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organisation fell into the hands of Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction, but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations, who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their recent World War enemies."
5,"Table tennis balls are individually marked with a star rating, indicating the strength of the plastic they are made from. 5 star balls are the strongest..but three stars are perfectly adequate for most average players. \n\nIn terms of brand, Stiga balls are very high quality and are used in most international tournaments including the Olympics. However, they are inevitably quite expensive.\n\nBalls made by Dunlop or Slazenger are generally very good and reasonably priced."

5,"Everyone who answered this is focusing on the offensive end. On offense Kobe is better because he can pull up for 3, midrange J or take you to the whole to get fouled, score, or dunk on someone. Wade has to drive that much because his Jumpshot is unreliable. This being said, Kobe is a MUCH BETTER man defender. Wade gets a lot of steals playing the passing lanes, but he has not shown he can shut someone down, NOT AT ALL. Kobe has been on the NBA's all defensive first and second team many times. Kobe is the best individual player on BOTH ENDS of the court. And just wait, so far this year Kobe's teammates are shooting well and playing with more confidence, this way Kobe will show he is a better team player than people give him credit for, and also, not having to score 35 points a game will let him spend more energy on D. Kobe is better all around, and still improving his game."

However, in 2006, Auburn redshirted 20 out of 22 freshmen and sophomores and still won 10 games.

5,"Practice, practice, practice....The trick to ollying is shifting your weight back and forward very quickly while controlling the board with your feet.  \n\n1. Make sure you have some good grip tape on the front of your board and good shoes that will grab it.  This will help keep the board tracking with your front foot.  \n\n2. Place your front foot just forward of the middle of the board and your rear foot at the tip of the tail.  I always tilt my rear heel up so I have just my toes on the tail.  This gives me the maximum ""kick"".\n\n3. Gain control of your board.  I've found that it is actually a bit easier to have the board slowly rolling forward on a level surface -- not too fast though.  \n\n4. With your feet in the above position, bend your knees slightly with your shoulders bent slightly over your front foot.  Your weight should be over your front foot.  \n\n5. Stomp your rear foot down on the tail and shift your weight backwards.\n\n6. As the board ""pops"" up use your front foot to keep it from flying out from under you.  This is done by keeping your foot flush with the board.  In actuality the angle of the board will be parallel with the side of your foot.  You can tell when you are doing it right when you get a scuff mark on your shoe right around the outside your little pinky toe.  \n\n7. Land it!  Push the top of your front foot out against the board to rotate it back underneath you.  By starting with your weight slightly forward and keeping your front foot flush with board in flight, your momentum should carry you and your board forward at the same pace allowing you to land smoothly.  \n\nUntil you are ready to get advanced with kick flips and such, you will know you are doing it right when the board never seems to leave your feet, but just becomes a single fluid motion.  You might want to exaggerate these steps as you practice this technique to get an idea of how the mechanics work.\n\nGood luck!"

5,"This is so because of a number of reasons \n\n1. Cricket originated in England and was only played by countries which were colonized by England (India, Australia, West Indies, S.Africa etc.)\n\n2. Cricket can get very boring and is played over five days and may end in a no result.\n\n3. Soccer though originating in England is much more fast paced and easier to play and was therefore copied and played by other countries which was not under Englands influence.\n\n4. The cost of equipment is much less for soccer than cricket so it makes it easier for poor kids to play.\n\n5. FIFA spends more money on developing the game than the ICC therefore they are able to reach more people\n\nFinally...soccer is just more exciting. played for just 90 intense minutes as opposed to 5 day cricket (one day cricket and a new type 20/20 cricket is catching on though and may increase crickets popularity)\n\nAnother thing...while cricket is a team game each player relys mainly on his own individual skill. If all the players on a cricket team are unskillful then that team is doomed to failure. However on a soccer team the players dont all have to be skillful but can be successful if they can combine well and play as a team.\n\nWatch the soccer world cup this year then watch the cricket world cup next year and compare.\n\nGermany for the world cup ?"

England is also a good place to catch a fight but they are just like Germany and only root for the hometown guy, not many places root the better fighter so if you had to choose one go with Australia, very little known but great fights (not fighters) and the fans are usually into most fights regardless of who fights also Mexico, fights are sometimes real exciting, better yet go to Mexico instead of Australia, not many Heavyweight fights but their is alot of excitment."

5,"Exactly. You got it completely right. The world cup is the place for the communication of civilizations and defining a team by the politics of its country is a unsporting attitude and should be punished right away.\n\nI give you an example, whenever Germany plays in the world cup does this team remind you of Adolph Hitler? If it does, then you got a problem. Exactly same with Iran, Iran's got a national team that plays for the pride of its people and has nothing to do with the government. For the honor of the same people who have been exploited and plundered by Ayatollahs and Arabs for centuries after the fall of Persian Empire. So the most stupid thing that someone can do is to identify a country by its politics in the world cup or like versa."

I even wrote a similar one called ""Casey at bat, the other side of the story"" telling the story of the team that beat mudville and the closer (John Smoltz) who got the save.\nBelow is the entire poem by Earnest Lawrence Thayer\n\nCasey at Bat\n\nThe outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;\nThe score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,\nAnd then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,\nA sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.\n\nA straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest\nClung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;\nThey thought, ""If only Casey could but get a whack at that —\nWe'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.""\n\nBut Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,\nAnd the former was a Looloo, while the latter was a cake;\nSo upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat;\nFor there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.\n\nBut Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,\nAnd Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;\nAnd when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,\nThere was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.\n\nThen from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;\nIt rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;\nIt knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,\nFor Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.\n\nThere was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;\nThere was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.\nAnd when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,\nNo stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.\n\nTen thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt.\nFive thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.\nThen while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,\nDefiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.\n\nAnd now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,\nAnd Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.\nClose by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped —\n""That ain't my style,"" said Casey. ""Strike one!"" the umpire said.\n\nFrom the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,\nLike the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;\n""Kill him! Kill the umpire!"" shouted some one on the stand;\nAnd it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.\n\nWith a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;\nHe stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;\nHe signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;\nBut Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said ""Strike two!""\n\n""Fraud!"" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered ""Fraud!""\nBut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,\nAnd they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.\n\nThe sneer has fled from Casey's lip, the teeth are clenched in hate;\nHe pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.\n\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright,\nThe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout;\nBut there is no joy in Mudville — mighty Casey has struck out."

My roommates (both Americans) and I have recently spent our afternoons watching the games.  I'd also really like to play, but I'm pretty bad at sports so I don't know how that would go over.  \n\nHowever, not everyone in the US loves soccer.  I think this has something to do with the fact that soccer is televised without commercial breaks.  This makes the major television companies less likely to carry it (even though there is a Fox soccer channel you can subscribe to) because they make a lot of their money on advertisements, which sports like (American) football allow for.  Still, soccer is a popular sport in American high schools, and I hope to see its popularity increasing as people become more drawn into the World Cup this year."

The victorious troops were asked in a condescending tone by some Virginians, who had retreated, ""Any more tar down in the Old North State, boys?"" The response came quickly: ""No, not a bit; old Jeff's bought it all up."" The Virginians asked: ""Is that so? What is he going to do with it?""

5,"Cheerleading is not a sport...it is an activity\n\nbecause there is no cler way to find a winner, just like figure skating or gymnastics shouldn't be considered sports either. A sport is something where a winner can be clearly identified, for example basketball, soccer, or hockey the team with the highest score wins. Or in track and field the person who runs the fastest of throws the furthest wins. However in things like cheerleading judges decide what is better, and some people may agree with or the decision and some not, whereas in a race the person who wins, wins as simple as that.\n\nExpense has nothing to do with it, people who play music have to spend money to but they don't play a sport.\n\nAs for the comment regarding competition cheerleading, in team sports if a player messes up it can cost the whole team, thats why its a team sport. But cheerleading is a team activity. In these competitions, how is the winner determined? by who makes the higher pyramid? no its based on the judges OPINION. \n\nAs for working hard, I'm sure some cheerleaders do work hard at it and it is hard work, but so is gardening, and construction work and you can't call those sports.\n\nLet me say I have nothing against cheerleading but for the above reasons I believe it is not a sport."
5,"Geocaching is an entertaining adventure game for gps users. Participating in a cache hunt is a good way to take advantage of the wonderful features and capability of a gps unit. The basic idea is to have individuals and organizations set up caches all over the world and share the locations of these caches on the internet. GPS users can then use the posted longitude and latitude location coordinates to find the caches. Once found, a cache may provide the visitor with a wide variety of rewards, treasures, trinkets, etc. All the visitor is asked to do is if they get something they should try to leave something for the cache.\n\nThere is currently over 200,000 geocaches world-wide.\n\nI personally have not placed any caches yet, but I have found just over 100 caches so far."

Generally speaking a shorter board is more manuverable but less stable and a longer board is less manuverable but more stable. Park riders like short boards and freeriders like longer boards. If you find that you like to ride really fast or in deeper snow, go longer. If you find that you like to ride slower, never hit the powder and like tighter turns then a shorter board will treat you right.\n\nI wouldn't go any shorter than a 140 for you."

5,"I used to have the same problem as you. My varsity coach noticed that I lost energy while playing for a long time at the start of the season. Every practice I would have to do running drills that will get me into shape. I did a lot of side stepping drills, running suicides, and jumping rope. According to my coach, jumping rope increases your agility on the court. It helped me a lot. After awhile, you'll notice a change in your game play and energy as long as you keep up with your footwork drills."
5,"Most of the wrestlers are no longer on steroids after WWE put in a Wellness Program where wrestlers will be suspended without pay for 30 days and they're taken off house shows.  They can still wrestle on live TV (Raw, SD, ECW) in order to continue storylines, but they're only paid for expenses. \n\nNow that being said, there are still wrestlers who still got busted for steroids and drugs.  Wrestlers who have been suspended for steroid or drug use AFTER the Wellness Program was implemented:  \n\nSteroids:  Randy Orton, Chris Masters.  Bob Holly.  Vince McMahon has admitted to past steroid use but I don't think he gets tested under the Wellness Program.\n\nSuper Crazy, Matt Hardy, and Lashley tested positive for elevated levels of enzyme in the liver.  Take that for what it is.  It's most likely from steroid use or pain killer since they were taken off PPV.\n\nSabu and RVD were busted for marijuana use.  Jeff Hardy was a big drug user in the past, but he's straightened himself since returning to WWE."

5,"I've contended since his rookie season how grossly NFL fans and pundits have overrated Big-Ben.  I've been head scratching since he came into the league, wondering why people can't see it's that championship caliber defense and top-rated, two-headed rushing attack that led to his success.  \n\nSure, he had his moments.  He's a big guy with quick feet who can escape the pocket and therefore extend the play.  Yes, he won a Super Bowl.  MAY I REMIND people of how he has played in many playoff games, to include the Super Bowl?  \n\nThe Patriots dared him to throw in his rookie year in the playoffs.  He choked badly.  He was just awful.  Don't take my word for it, watch the tape or look up the stats.\n\nThat same year he won against the Jets in spite of tossing some God-awful, untimely interceptions.  Just awful.  Again, watch the tape---it doesn't lie.  \n\nFast-forward to last year's Super Bowl.  He was just awful.  Statistically, I might add, the WORST performance ever by a winning QB in the Super Bowl.  Fact.  He threw THREE (3) interceptions, ZERO (0) touchdowns, while completing less than half (the equivalent of batting .200 in a baseball series) of his passes for barely over 100 yards.  He was just awful.   BUT----he had that monster, bone-crushing defense and a pounding rushing attack no other team in football possessed (with the varity of backs at his disposal, combined with his O-line's ability to create holes).  \n\nHe's got some talent, and I get why Pittsburgh likes him after the ""Slash"" Stewart debacle, but watch the games.  Watch him play.  A big pass or two down the field for touchdowns every now and again, or a 15 yard scramble on 3rd down does NOT an excellent quarterback make.   And he thrives off play action, but heck----even I could sell the run if I had a top rated rushing attack at my disposal.  You rush the ball 15 times in a row for 5, 10 yards a carry and duhhh----there's going to be some play-action fake opportunities!  \n\nHis medical issues are only compounding the harsh reality that without a championship caliber defense (yes, it's good but not what it once was), and without that POUNDING rushing attack (""Fast"" Willie Parker is a fine back, but not a pounding, classic in-between the tackles runner the Steelers have thrived on), you could line up on all four downs, if need be, and hammer away for a first down 4-5 yards at a whack----his true colors are shining through.  He may one day be a journeyman caliber guy, but for now, he throws interceptions like they're going out of style (he threw them more often than 3/4 of the league, by the way, his rookie year----in spite of the fact he attempted fewer passes than any other player in the league.  Dead last).\n\nThe Steelers won in SPITE of Ben last year.  And while stats only tell part of a story, sometimes they tell a very clear and convincing story.  The guy had the worst statistical performance EVER by a starting QB, people.  EVER!  To defend him with statements such as, ""Well yeah, but he won the game!"" is just nonsense.  It's glib nonsense.  It would be like a pitcher walking 9 batters, giving up 5 home runs and 19 hits over 6 innings before getting pulled for a reliever, but winning the game 9-8 because his offense out-slugged the other team.  To argue, ""Well, that pitcher won the game, baby!  He's a winner!"" is congruous to what Steeler fans say about Big Ben."

5,"I picked group C as the toughest from the get go. Group C consists of Argentina, Holland, Serbia-Montenegro and Ivory Coast. Argentina and Holland already two strong teams with good young players, but as the last World Cup showed, these factors may not mean anything.\nA lot of people might think that Serbia-Montenegro and Ivory Coast won't pose any threat. But I think Ivory Coast is actually the best African team in the tournament, and they showed their class by reaching the African Cup Nations final. Ivory Coast will give the rest troubles just like Senegal did in World Cup 2002. \nMoving on, Serbia-Montenegro has a pretty good team. I expect them to give a lot of troubles with their defensive style of playing. They qualified in front of Spain and Belgium. This may not say a lot, but Spain and Belgium are considered more as regulars than Serbia-Montenegro, especially Spain. I don't see them having as much spectacles as Bulgaria (1994) and Croatia (1998), but I see them giving a hard time to the rest of the group.\nAll and all, I still hope Argentina and Holland to qualify to the next round."

And in that clash of egos, the Tuna will win every time.\n\nHolt was injured this year and, as he continues to get older, I would expect that may happen more often ... limiting his time on the field and his opportunities to score points.\n\nHarrison, while still a major part of the Indianapolis offense, is still only a part of a great receiving corps in Indy ... and since Payton Manning figured out the key to success is distributing the ball to all of those receivers, Harrison's numbers will likely level out. If anyone will catch or pass Smith, I think it will be Harrison and he'll still be a top player in most leagues -- but I don't think he'll be the very top guy like he used to be."

The only person who could really put him there is that guy who's been going to jail on contempt of court charges instead of testifying....and I suspect he will continue to do so.  (Wonder how much he's being paid not to squeal?)\nIronically, had Bonds NOT taken steroids, he would have wound up his career with a lot better reputation than he will now, despite all the gaudy batting statistics."

5,"Silva definitely. I personally don't like him but Liddell wouldn't stand a chance. Wanderlei is physically stronger his Thai boxing is a lot better and his jiu jitsu skills are more advanced then Liddell's as well. Chuck's only advantage might be in his wrestling skills which are better then Silva's in my opinion but I don't think it would make much difference in this match. So once again my pick is Wanderlei by TKO or a KO in the first or early in the second round.\nThis match could actually happen soon because Wanderlei is a free agent now, his contract with Pride recently expired. And if UFC presents him a good offer we might be seeing this. I really hope we do."

5,"The Wikipedia links have much of the story, but the real answer is that the team owners decide, usually by authorizing the league to make changes.  Today that would be a decision of all the owners on behalf of MLB, as when the leagues expanded and when the Milwaukee Brewers were moved from the American to the National League.\n\nWhy do some states (and cities) have teams in both leagues?  Competition, pure and simple.  The American League itself was founded for that reason, and it was why the original Baltimore Orioles became the New York Yankees.  In fact, part of the 1905 agreement that established the World Series as an annual affair specified that the American League would not move a franchise to Pittsburgh to compete with the Pirates.\n\nThe New York Mets and Houston Astros - indeed all of the expansion franchises and most of the recent franchise moves -also exist because of competition.  When the Giants moved to San Francisco, a minority shareholder who opposed the move, Joan Payson (who also unsuccessfully tried to buy the Giants from Horace Stoneham and thus prevent the move), had enough money to back a new major league, the Continental League, which would have teams in Atlanta, Buffalo, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York and Toronto.  (All these cities except Buffalo now have major league teams.)   The AL and NL folded and added four new teams, the others being the second Washington Senators franchise (now the Rangers) and the Los Angeles Angels (no ""of Anaheim"" in those days).  The man who organized the Continental League, William A. Shea, is the man for whom Shea Stadium is named.  Payson became the first owner of the Mets.\n\nSometimes moves occur because the team owner wishes to move to greener pastures, as with the Giants, Dodgers, Athletics, the Milwaukee (ex-Boston) Braves and the Seattle Pilots (now the Brewers)."

5,"There are a lot of factors involved in sucessful archery hunting.  Becoming proficient with your bow is important.  This will only happen if your arrow (spine and length) is matched properly to your bow (draw weight, draw length, and broadhead weight).  Range estimation is critical.  I have found that trying to use a rangefinder is difficult under field conditions when the game is nearby due to the movement required.  If you hunt from a stand, mark 10, 20, and 30 yards from it with orange marker ribbon tied to trees or brush.  Use of sights and the type to use is a personal choice.  Some of the best bowhunters I know don't use any type of sights at all.  Knowledge of the habits of your quarry have a great influence on sucess.  Game animal movements are usually governed by access to food sorces and these change with the seasons, several times a year.  Most movement (except during rut) is between a food source and the nearest bedding area.  Try to set up to ambush animals moving from the bedding to the feeding area (evening) and back to the bedding area (morning).  Stalking and still hunting require a good deal of skill (practice) and an enourmous amount of patience, but can provide some of the most exciting oppurtunities.  Most people who try to stalk or still hunt move way too fast and just move the animals ahead rarely seeing them.  In thick cover, about 400-500 yards an hour is good.   Make certain you always use a razor-sharp broadhead.  Archery kills are made by blood loss, not trauma.  Patience is a virtue after the shot also.  Even if you are certain you made a vital hit, wait at least 30 minutes.  An hour is better, provided rain or snow isn't going to destroy the blood trail.  Speaking of which, you need to be able to follow the trail left by the animal.  Mostly this means blood trailing.  If you hunt in the evening and stick one near dark, you have to have a good light source to trail after dark.  A Coleman lantern is the best choice for this, but a 3 or 4 ""D"" cell maglite works and will fit in a backpack.  Blood less than a couple hours old is still very shiny in bright light.  Direction of blood spatters indicate direction of animal's movement and size and frequency of drops indicate speed of movement.  Large (8"" or more) spots and puddles indicate the animal stopped for a period of time and bled in one spot.  Also watch for pieces of your arrow as all or some of it may work out of the wound.  Sorry for the long winded answer, but as I said, a lot goes into it.  Read any books by Chuck Adams, probably the finest bowhunter ever.  Good luck and good hunting."

5,"A Paso Fino is a gaited horse, but to leave the description at that  is like saying the Pacific Ocean is water. Gaited horses come in  many varieties, but none surpass the quality and  smoothness of gait experienced with the Paso Fino breed. The Paso Fino exhibits this  quality  from birth, with foals only hours old performing the perfect four beat rhythm the breed is noted  for. Paso Fino horses come in all sizes, shapes and colors. They can be found as tall as 16  hands  for those to whom height is important and as small as 13 for those  to whom it is not.  The body styles vary from stocky to streamlined.  All colors are found except the Appaloosa pattern. The breed is noted for it's agility,  intelligence and hardiness. \nThey come from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Columbia and Venezuela as the original countries. For many generations the Paso Fino was a Latin breed.  Breeders in these areas had no need for large horses, as the native peoples were not large of stature themselves. They did however have great pride in the appearance of their horses and execution of gait so they breed to enhance these characteristics. The Paso Fino became a horse that carried itself with much pride, or ""brios"" and the unique short strided, rapid footfall of the classic Fino or Fino Fino became prized in their native lands. \n\nPaso Fino walk, gait and canter. The Paso Fino gait is performed at three speeds with the level of collection varying , the  speeds are Classic Fino, Paso Corto, and Paso Largo  The horses perform the gait in three styles, the Classic Fino, Performance and the Pleasure style. The gait is perfect four beat neither lateral nor diagonal. with the footfall being left hind, left front, right hind right front,  the same as the natural walk.    The gait is a natural, it is not uncommon for newborn foals to be gaiting shortly after birth. Gait may be refined through training, but no artificial training equipment or special shoeing is used  .  \n\n\n\nClassic Fino is by far the most breath taking to watch or experience. The horse is  balanced and collected with rapid footfall and slow forward speed, demonstration a rapid, steady, and unbroken rhythm. Their feet are moving faster than you can drum your leg with your hands, and they are moving forward at a speed slower than your normal walking speed. The Classic Fino (or FINO FINO) has extremely short rapid footfall, sounds like the rapid roll of a drum, with VERY slow forward speed.  The horses perform in complete collection, with upright carriage and neck breaking at the poll to allow the head to be held almost on the vertical.  Only a small percentage of the Paso Fino can perform this gait.  To perform it well requires natural ability and an athlete, the horse must be supple, balanced and in great physical form to be able to sustain the Classic Fino. The Dons of the countries of origin found it a point of pride to own and ride the BEST of these Classic Fino Stallions.  These men often weighed 200 to 400 lbs., and the horses would carry them for hours as they surveyed their lands.  The Paso Fino became a breed with much heart and endurance and a natural gait which was passed on from one generation to the next. \n\nPaso Corto is a ground covering gait witch is ideal for pleasure, and trail riding. About the speed of a trot or rack or running walk. The Corto moves forward at about the speed of the trot in non-gaiting breeds, collection is mild and extension varies within the two styles (Pleasure and Performance). Performance horses tend to perform a slower Corto, with a shorter stride and more rapid footfall. Hock action and rear end drive and execution being prized in this style of Paso Fino (The Performance Paso). The Pleasure Paso Fino tends to have a faster, more relaxed Corto.  Less execution is expected, but no loss of smoothness or gait footfall pattern. Most Classic Fino horses are also capable of performing a Corto, and when they do it is in the"

The local news media has also brought this subject matter up a few times. And this was said around new years and in the last NBA Finals, so it has been reiterated a few times."

As I was watching the bruins fail to sink shot-after-shot, I was reminded of my own beloved Mizzou Tigers.\n\nI had expected the game to be a lot closer, considering that each team had the same record coming into the tournament.  I have great respect for the players and the coaching staff of the Gators, and I look forward to seeing them in the Big Dance again next year."

5,"I've been asking myself the same question ever since the season began.\n\nI think Lebron has huge chances. The Cavs are doing good and basically, they depend on Lebron to do almost everything. Cavs are a team of nobodies, and if Lebron does have a 52+ win season averaging 29/6/6, He will be a shoe-in for MVP. If not, blame the judges.\n\nOther players I consider for the MVP award are: Dirk Nowitzki, Dallas; Steve Nash, Phoenix (He's got the assist stat owned so why not); Carlos Boozer, Utah (guy's been really good this year); Dwyane Wade (Wade's still the same high-powered scoring offensive beast out on the court, but his team isn't doing so well); and Tim Duncan (Probably another best record in the NBA. If Duncan keeps up his 22/12/3 effort, He could be a deadly candidate); Yao Ming (He's shown he deserved the first overall draft pick selection and he is healthy); and Kobe Bryant (Im still doubtful about this; hope Kobe returns to his 81-point form, but with more assists).\n\nThat's all I got. I still think LBJ will get it all."

5,"Lawn Tennis Dimensions\n\nThe court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and its width is 27 feet (8.23 m) for singles matches and 36 feet (10.97 m) for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts, and 3 feet (914 mm) high in the center.\n\nBasketball Dimensions\n\nThe men's ball's circumference is about 30 inches (76 cm) and weighs about 1 lb 5 oz (600 g). The women's ball's circumference is about 29 inches (73 cm) and weighs about 1 lb 3 oz (540 g). A regulation basketball court in international games is 28 by 15 meters (approx. 92 by 49 ft) and in the NBA is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 m). Most courts are made of wood.\n\nA cast-iron basket with net and backboard hang over each end of the court. At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly 10 feet (3.05 m) above the court and 4 feet (1.2 m) inside the endline. While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be the correct height; a rim that is off by but a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.\n\nVolleyball Dimensions\n\nThe game is played on volleyball courts 18 metres long and 9 metres wide, divided into two 9 x 9 metre ""team courts"" by a one-metre wide net placed such that its highest point is 2.43 metres above the ground in men's competition, and 2.24 metres for women's competition (these heights are varied for veterans and junior competitions). There is a line 3 metres from and parallel to the net in each team court termed the ""attack line"". This ""3 metre"" line divides the court into ""back row"" and ""front row"" areas. These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area ""1"", which is the position of the serving player\n   \n          positions \n             4  3  2 \n             5  6  1"

5,"Skins are what the skins game is played for. A skins game pits players in a type of match play in which each hole has a set value (usually in money or points). The player who wins the hole is said to win the ""skin,"" and whatever that skin is worth. Skins games are often more dramatic than standard match play because holes are not halved. When players tie on a given hole, the value of that hole is carried over and added to the value of the following hole. The more ties, the greater the value of the skin and the bigger the eventual payoff. For example, a friendly skins game might be played for $1 per hole. If three holes in a row are played without a winner, then the fourth hole is worth $4 ($1 for its own value, plus a dollar for each hole that carries over)."

And I think his average at the end of the season will likely be in the .300-.310 range.\n\nAs an all-around player, Rios is worth having.  He's a plus defensive player with good speed and things like that never go into slumps.  I do believe that he's going to continue to have a strong season and I do believe he's a bright young player.\n\nAt 25 years old, he's just beginning to come into his prime.  He's starting to fill out and put on muscle and should hit for more power in the years to come (that said, he can be a 40 homer a year type of guy.)\n\nIf you're in a keeper league, this is definitely a guy you'd want (Much like Grady Sizemore of Cleveland, who will also continue to get better as he matures).\n\nRios is definitely for real (unless you expect him to hit another 20-25 homers and drive in another 80 runs for the remainder of the season... then you're over-reaching.)"

Sweden exploited a horrible back 4 from the dead ball situations and top teams are going to notice that weakness. They could have easily been beaten 5-2 by the Swedes were it not for a couple of clearances off the line and bad breaks for the Swedes.\n\nThey haven't been impressive and teams with offensive threats like the Swedes will attack the slow & old back four.

5,"There is no way that a human being can generate 150 mph bat speed in the 45/100ths of a second that it takes a 90 mile an hour fastball to travel from the pitcher's hand to the plate.\n\nTypical bat speeds are measured more in the 80s or 90s, but it may surprise you to know that faster bat speeds are not necessarily associated with balls that are hit for distance. In fact, the fastest bats generally belong to line drive and spray hitters like Ichiro, who can whip the bat through the zone, driving the ball on a line. Power hitters tend to use heavier bats, and consequently swing more slowly, allowing the bat to ""stay on the ball"" longer, and impart more force and impact to ""turning the ball around"".\n\nI've linked a couple of articles that discuss this - one is fairly hairy, and depends on a knowledge of physics - the other two are for general audiences, and fairly easy to understand.

5,"What makes the offside rule especially complicated is that a player can be in an ""offside position"" without being offside. Two things are necessary to be ""offside"":\n\n1st - The player must be in an ""offside position"" at the moment the ball is ""played"" by a teammate. To be in an ""offside position"", a player must be on the opponent's half of the field & closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball & the second-last defender. A player is not in an offside position if he is on his own half of the field (i.e. the half his goalkeeper is on), or even with the second-to-last defender or the last 2 defenders. (The goalkeeper is usually the last defender, or one of the last two, but he might not be; the rules just refer to the last 2 defenders & don't mention the goalkeeper). This is often difficult to call. (For example, if a player is even with the Second Last Defender & thereby in an ""onside position"" but runs past the Second Last Defender a split second after his teammate makes a through pass. In this example, the player is not offside because he was in an onside position at the moment the ball was played.)\n\n2nd - The player must be involved in ""active play"" by either:\n\n    * gaining an advantage by being in an offside position, or\n\n    * interfering with play, or\n\n    * interfering with an opponent"

5,"Henderson\n\nDrew Brees/Joe Horn/Marques Colston/Devery Henderson (vs. ATL)\nSimilar passing attacks that have faced the Falcons this season: Saints, Bengals\nFF Points Allowed vs. similar QBs: 14.5\nFF Points Allowed vs. similar WRs: 25.4\nFF Points Allowed vs. QBs/WRs over the last 3 weeks: 13/16.8\n\nNotes: Brees has become about as good of a start as Peyton as he’s been on fire lately (mostly because the defense has been so bad). As much as it probably hurts his owners, sit Colston unless you hear some very encouraging news late Friday or Saturday. This makes Horn and Henderson (with the Colston injury) solid plays. The Falcons defense is a shell of what it was to start the season."

5,"If it slipped off him then he would yell at you for not pissing the right way. Then it would aired on sports center for the next week. Then when the Cowboys are ahead by 20 pts, he would catch a TD pass ( when it doesn't matter) and do a end zone celebration about you pissing on him the wrong way. Then TO would write a children's book about it."

5,"Actually I saw Audlee Harrison get beat by a no name on BFC and he has yet to fight any BIG names in the U.S. to prove himself. If you are judging by best English heavyweight he may be the one but I would have to go with Vladimir Klitchko for current best heavyweight over all. He proved this by beating Sam Peter, an undefeated hopeful, and dominating Cris Byrd. He is taking on the best of the best. His critics point to his lost to Brewster where he wore himself out but you have to remember he dominated every minute of the fight before that and there was no rematch. I think he just had a bad night."

5,"I really don't think so. Even with Chelsea 18 points ahead, Manchester United pulled it down to 7. There is always hope. Besides, Chelsea have made more excitement and news in the Premiership than ever. Now the title race at the beginning of the season has 4 hopefuls: Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal, and Liverpool. In previous seasons it used to be only 2.\n\n The Champions League race is hotter this season than any other i remember with Blackburn, Bolton, Arsenal, and Tottenham fighting for the last spot, and UEFA Cup. \n\nThe relegation fight is not as eventful with Sunderland and WestBrom almost certain to fall. The only interest is Portsmouth miraculous escape."

5,"get enough players to form 3 teams or groups..then have one team stand on one side of the goal and another team on the other side and have the last team at the middle of the field..make sure everyplayer has a ball. (this trains your goaly and all the players) okay have one person(player 1) from midfield dribble their ball to the 18 and take a shot at goal..then have another person(player 2) who is standoing next to teh goal kick it to player 1.have player one try to kick it in the goal.then player 2 can go to midfield. have another player(player 3) from the other side of the goal throw the ball into the air so that player 1 can head it in to the goal.after player 1 has taken 3 shots he/she will take player 3's postion,player 3 will take player 2's position and player 2 will take player 1's postion.(rotate) this drill helps evryone with kicking,passing,and heading and helps the goaly with blocking saving,and diving.have the players keep doing this so evryone has about 3 turns to take shots on goal. after this split up the players into groups of 5. have 3 players on one side and 2 on teh other and make sure they are about 15-20 away.have the frist person dribble the ball to the player on teh oppostie side and just drop it off so the other player can continue with this..this is good for short dribbles and passing\n\ni really hope this helped and wasnt so confusing ..we use these drills right before everygame and it REALLY helps\n\n:)------:)-------:)----------:)-----------:)-----:)--------:)------------:)-------:)"

Demolish MSU!!!"
5,"i'de have to say flanker because you are like the outside linebacker in football you are the first one out of the scrum and looking for that first tackle.  it is usually the best combination of size, athaletic ability, agressiveness, and meanness.  i played prop and flanker and second row and an occasional hooker.  hooker sucks because contrary to somebodies opinion your fists are behind your prop's back and have nothing to protect yourself with if the scrum does collapse which you will be on the bottom of head first."
5,"I don't really have a team but I really like watching it. If I had to choose a team right now it will be the Carolina Panthers. I was going for now for the Super Bowl but the lost to Seahawks because they could not run the ball, 4 guys were on Steve Smith, and Jake was making bad decisions. Next year it going to be tough for the defense but they have Keyshawn Johnson now and have a second big target. Go Panthers!"
5,"no,\n skiing is awesome. you always can do something new if its doing a new rail or jumping off cliffs skiing's better."
5,"I thought Ghana did a fantastic job. The score really doesn't reflect how well played the game was. Especially given the third goal; at that point, Ghana had little choice but to push forward and play more aggressively, and eventually it caught up to them. And could have a few more times; their goalie kept quite busy at the end.\n\nBrazil is the best team in the world. Ghana was a surprise to even be there. I think they played a hall of a game, all in all."
5,"Well of course it really depends how good you are.\nSponsors aren't looking to outfit decent players, they are looking for great players that already have great stuff. Not because they won't give you great stuff, but they know that you are in the game for the long haul, and willing to spend lots of time/money in the game.\nThe best first sponsor will be a local paint ball range. Generally they'll sponsor you by you trading your time to ref, and teach/recruit new players. They'll normally give you free range time, compressed air refills, and paint balls at cost. Bigger and better sponsors can be achieved after this, if you're good."
5,Each club has their own websites and for a small subscription they allow you to watch the games. All the answers before this are just as good
5,"They should be better this year, with more speed and better pitching staffs.  But they would probably still finish last in AL west.  Athletics, Angels and Rangers are still better teams."
5,"Zidan he is a better player, and has accomplished a lot more.  Beckham is just a pretty boy model and that is why he makes more from the advertisements.  Zidane is deffinately on of the best players ever to play the game, that is why he deserves the bigger salary."
5,3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw. No other way to get points. After that it's all about the goals scored.
5,"MJ cuffs the ball, downs Kobe to his back and throws the ball high to run off the final 1.6 seconds."
5,"ok, from history i know kedging is a means of moving a sail boat, that is no long used anymore since the invention of motors.  but it involved the use of a special anchor called a kedge anchor which was towed in the direction the sail boat wanted to move by some crew members in a row boat, then once in place the crew on the sail boat heaved in (pulled) on the anchor and the sail boat moved forward towards the kedge anchor.\n\nit would not be effective if you wanted to travel very far, but it would be useful to drag the ship off of a shallow bank, or if there is no wind for the boat to sail with."
5,The R7 weighting system does actually change your ball flight.  You have to remember thought this is when you hit it in the sweet spot. No amount of screws can fix a slice of a ball that hit the toe of the club. Pros mainly use the weights to help with either their current patterns or wind.

5,Detroit Tigers   Milwaukee Brewers
5,"Detroit is prolonging the the series to get mo money.  They already know that they will face Miami in the finals and will dominate.  Basketball is rigged and it is exactly like professional wrestling.  Most of what you watch has already been figured out and the point spreads fixed to keep the bettors off guard and the rich-rich.  Look at The Superbowl where Seattle was robbed by the officials.  If a game gets to look too far out of place the officials are there to bring it back into perspective.  Don't believe me-I will tell you now that college teams are the real champs and that is why the US Olympic team was shot down.  Because when it comes time to play real ball they are so outta sync that they can not function as a team.  Why not let the US NBA team play for The Olympics as a reward and as representation of OUR Champions.  Because They Cheat and the Olympics would disgrace the US by permanently barring them.  However if we allowed Florida State (and I pulled for Gonzaga by-the-way) to represent U.S., we would have true team spirited champions giving it there all for their country.  They could give a sHEEt about the money HOMEY!"

5,"I have jumped static, freefall and AFF (accelerated Freefall) including one over the North Pole out of the back of a jet.\n\nThe flight up isn't too bad although, I wont lie to you, you will be scared ... the few seconds to the door are pretty nerve-wracking but once you are out (and past the sensory overload) you will be amazed.\n\nNot sure what type of skydive you are thinking about - for a first time jumper your choices are really a static line from pretty low (2000 ft ish) or a tandem (from c15,000 with a c50 sec free-fall). Both have their advantages but the freefall is probably what you want to feel.\n\nIf you freefall (most likely tandem for a first jump but you can do AFF)there is little or no sensation of falling but rather just being blasted in a strong (upward) wind. Pay the extra for a video of the jump - you wont regret it.\n\nIf you need any more info drop me a note.\n\n\nBlue Skies =8-)"

5,"Absolutely, but not in Olympic play.\n\nAs a spectator sport, hockey could use some livenin' up, and fistfights do just that.

His commentary is usually insightful and as a master trainer he is able to notice things rounds earlier and is able to provide tidbits of information that others simply do not see. I think kellerman is alright but he kind of seems to run over fran and they have a few chemistry things to work on with their crew i think. Lewis is alright but he is still being led by the hand i believe, some of the things he says still sound pretty scripted and they other things are a bit on the silly side.\n\nBut Steward is fantastic in my opinion."

Given i am Australian, watching the Australian team play, albeit in important matches, increases my interest. \n\n If you support the team, then on the pitch you will feel the emotions of the team playing.  You will cry at the missed shots on goal.\n\nSo, i suggest you invest your time in a team, or watch a high quality football match, or a match of one importance."

In addition, the league has funded the the NFL Europe league for several years.  \n\nI don't know that the league has a separate specific marketing campaign for Women, but according to the NFL 40% of their fanbase are women with league licensees expanding their merchanise offerings to products targeting females. \n\nThe league is corporate partner of the United Way which helps lots of charity organizations across the country including disabled groups.  In addition, the league has had several high profile players suffer delibitating injuries like Daryl Stingley and Mike Utley. \n\nBefore you criticize the league for not appealing to homosexuals, the outgoing commissioner of the NFL, Paul Tagliabue, was honored last year by PFLAG's Stay Close campaign."

5,"Rules"" Of The Kumite\nThe Kumite takes place over three days. The day before The Kumite starts, all fighters must provide their invitation to the judges. Fighting with the other fighters in The Kumite, outside of a sanctioned match, is strictly forbidden. If a fighter is caught breaking this rule, both fighters are automatically disqualified. Provided that the events of Bloodsport are followed, the tournament layout is:\n\nDay One is the round of 64 and round of 32. \nDay Two is the round of 16 and round of 8. \nDay Three is the final four and championship match. \nMatches in The Kumite continue until one of the fighters satisfy one of rules of winning.

5,"Eventually, the AFL would like to have teams from every state and territory. There isn't too much of a culture of AFL in Tasmania, however, Aussie Rules is played in many Indigenous Communites in the Northern Territory, which could contribute to the forming of a team.

5,"No, they don't get paid too much, NASCAR drivers EARN THEIR MONEY by playing(racing)hard just as much as other sports stars do. Driving a NASCAR stocker, or ANY race car for that matter, is PHYSICALLY DEMANDING, a lot more than some people think. Why do you think certain drivers pay attention to exercise(Carl Edwards and Mark Martin both exercise daily)...to give them an edge when racing! Look at a Nextel Cup driver right after a race...they look really exhausted and sweaty..because they ARE. A Nextel Cup or Busch Series car gets pretty d*mn hot, add to that the length of the race(usually at least 4 hours)...And yes, they put their lives on the line...but it's not only for the money. They do it because they love what they do, and they do it for us fans who support them week after week. Could any of you who say stupid things about NASCAR do that? I don't think so."

5,"If your swing speed is really high, yes lower compression means less distance, otherwise no it's the other around for low club head speed and low compression, the ball actaully goes further. When the club head hits the ball, it actaully compress the ball to a point when it flatten out a little (that's why it leave a big around ball mark on the club face). The more you can compress the ball on the impact, the further the ball tend to go. \n\nThink of it that if the ball is really hard; i.e. high compression ball, it is harder to press it down, but it will bounce off stronger and therefore go further. Using high compression ball with low club head speed works the other way around, that is the ball won't go as far. Tiger Woods' Nike ball is made with a little higher compression (I think more than a 100). They used to make a 110 for Dunlop, it's  a piece of rock, and with say 80 mile per hour club head speed, you actually lose distance over hard ball.\nThe feel of the ball is a totally difference story."

5,"I think it was a bad game from Chelsea. For the first hour their defense made so many mistakes, allowing Liverpool to profit from it. This is very evident in the second goal.\n\nThe first goal should not have been, as Terry kicked the ball away. The free kick was an incorrect decision. That being said, Chelsea did not deal with it properly and the players avoided the ball rather than blocking it.\n\nIn the last 30 minutes Chelsea played well and put Liverpool under so much pressure. However Liverpool have withstood Chelsea's pressure before.\n\nIn the end I think a draw would have been fair, but Liverpool deserved to win (not on their own merit), but because Chelsea made life so hard on themselves with all the mistakes.\n\n\nAnd to answer the previous comments. Jose Mourinho was spot on in his post match interview. He might have been a bit harsh on Liverpool but it was obvious he knew his team had played poorly early on. Like I said, the first goal did not do his team justice as Chelsea had bossed the game up until then. \n\nAnd Chelsea do not suck. They are top of the table for a reason, and would still be in the champions league if Del Horno had not been sent off in the first leg. They will soon win their second consecutive Premiership trophy. They are 15 points ahead of Liverpool and the league shows how good a team really is. You can have one bad game in a cup and get knocked out, but in the league it shows who the best team is."

If you do something DAILY with him, practice dribbling the ball (many point guards in the NBA grew up by bouncing their ball to school, playing a lot, and bouncing their ball all the way home). Pete Maravich would have his Dad drive the car slowly while Pete sat in the front passenger seat with the window rolled down. He bounced the ball outside the car door!!!\nPete would also take a LOT OF SHOTS everyday! He would probably shoot a minimum of 500 shots (made shots) before he quit practice. But, if your son does NOT want to do the hard work it takes to get better, you will have to find a way to motivate him! Take him to some games High School, College, or NBA games can often inspire others to want to get better! My cousin was once a WORLD CHAMPION in the NBA and his desire rubbed off onto me. Hard efficient planning and follow through will get you where you want to go!

I'd guess well under 1% who play daily.\nThose who do play daily almost always have friends or family who play and who encourage them. Even those who play high school tennis often play only during the season. \nThose who do play daily are likely to be serious about getting good, and will usually be taking lessons somewhere and often will belong to a tennis club. \nAnd yes, there is hardly an area where tennis courts are not available. In colder climates, there are indoor facilities that allow year-round play."

I'm not sure why, but it seems most WNBA/pro soccer women do the same thing as men.  I think maybe it's a desire to avoid ""playing like girl."""

5,"Baltimore could be a sleeper team this year, but I don't think it really has anything to do with Steve McNair.  While his addition is nice, a big offense has never been Baltimore Ravens football.  It's all about defense.  The biggest problem last year was Ray Lewis.  He had no defensive line.  Ray Lewis' production depends on strong lineman keeping the O-line at bay so he can move around and hit the holes.  He depends on speed versus strength, which makes him a bad match with the ""big uglies"".  Baltimore made some good moves to bulk up the D-line, including drafting a big lineman from Oregon.  We could see the rebirth of the nasty Ravens D this year."

5,"The WM system was created in the mid-1920s by Herbert Chapman of Arsenal to counter a change in the offside law in 1925. The change had reduced the number of opposition players that an attacker needed between himself and the goal-line from three to two. This led to the introduction of a centre-back to stop the opposing centre-forward, and tried to balance defensive and offensive playing. The formation became so successful that by the late-1930s most English clubs had adopted the WM. Retrospectively the WM has either been described as a 3-2-5 or as a 3-4-3."

5,"Yeah, I was rooting for Italy, but my allegiances almost shifted with them making the goal for the other team and then Di Rossi's display. It's that Latin heat that got juiced when they screwed up.\nIn general, it was an all around disturbing game from many aspects, including the ref, etc. But yes, I agree with you that his behavior lacked class and sportsmanship."
5,"If the pros thought they'd have an advantage by carrying 13 drivers and a putter, then they would.

At their level of play, it's all mental."
5,"The Steelers should definitely start Charlie Batch of Roethlisberger.  I attended the Steelers and Falcons game in which Big Ben got that concussion.  So the Steelers bring in Charlie Batch and don't miss a beat.  He leads a couple of great drives to force the game into overtime.  Batch has played SOOOOOOOO much better than Roethlisberger.  Roethlisberger has twice as many INTs as TDs, those are not stats that get you a starting job in th NFL.  Big Ben is so overrated."

5,"The FIFA World Cup Trophy is made of solid gold and malachite. It is made by the Italian sculptor Silvio Gazzaniga. He described his creation in these words: ""The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory"". The trophy is 36 cm high, made of solid 18-carat gold and weighs 4,970 grams. The base contains two layers of semi-precious malachite and has room for 17 small plaques bearing the name of the winners - space enough for the World Champions up to the year 2038. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy cannot be won outright, as the regulations state that it shall remain FIFA's own possession. The World Cup winners retain it until the next tournament and are awarded a gold-plated replica."

5,"Probably all the way. Unless they run into a team like Villanova, in which almost every 3 point attempt goes in. That's how Marquette and Villanova beat UCONN. Excellent shooting.\n\nSo if Redick goes on a shooting spree, and he gets help from his teammates, Duke might actually beat UCONN if they ever meet up in the tourney."
5,"Poor management by the MLS.  This was during the ""Americanization"" phase of the MLS, with penalty shootouts to settle ties, funny team names and the clock counting down to zero.  This in effect had the result opposite of ""preaching to the choir"" that is ignoring the choir all together, where the largest groups interested in soccer where somewhat ignored in hopes of garnering new fans.  An example of this would be the choices in stadiums.  Tampa played in the Buccaneers' stadium, way too large and unaccommodating for the Mutiny's needs.  The Fusion had their games in Fort Lauderdale, far away from a large segment of the fan base in Miami ( a more central location between the two cities would have been better ) in a rather unimpressive stadium.  Finally, at the time of their axing, these two teams where far away from the other ones in the MLS, so it was also a cost cutting measure for time and travelling."

5,"To be more specific than ""don't snap your wrist"". \n\nGrip the ball with the index and middle fingers together so that the middle finger is just inside the seam and put your thumb at 180 from the fingers so 1/2 the ball is ""sticking out"" (sort of like it's floating in water except in your hand).\nWhen you deliver the ball, twist your wrist ahead of time to avoid the ""snapping"" motion which causes tendon/ligament damage. when you release the ball, your delivery should be almost like you're reaching out in front of you and grabbing a rope and pulling it down.\nThe most important thing about a curveball is the mechanics. Push off the mound using your legs, deliver the ball in the correct postion, and most importantly follow through with your whole body, not just your arm.\n\nAfter you try this a bit it will start to work EVERY time. It feels very funny at first though."

5,Either Tracy McGrady or Kevin Garnett.
5,"You might be partially correct on that one. Since Phoenix used their run-and-gun system last year, most of the teams also went running. This causes people not getting back on defense and it will just be a test of offense.\n\nWhy partially correct? San Antonio is still arguably the best defensive team in the league. Their backcourt runs, but their front court gets back on D as quickly. As far as four games go, none of their opponents scored more than 93 points."
5,"Tue fans, will follow the team no matter what. The bandwagon people, we'll see them again in South Africa 2010. And yes, the team should have played better. Getting beating 3-0 is not good for a team as good as the US. No matter who the opponent is."
5,"You're comparing apples and oranges, here. The M16 and the M60 were designed with two entirely different roles in mind. The M16 was designed as a ""point target"" rifle, meaning it is meant to be used most effectively against individual targets by putting rapid, accurate firepower in the hands of an individual soldier. The M60 was designed as a medium machine gun to fulfill the squad automatic weapon role (before the term was coined, of course). It is an ""area target"" weapon, meant not entirely to kill the enemy, but to also to pin groups of them down and keep them from shooting back. These two weapons were used in conjunction with each other so their individual strengths and weaknesses would compliment each other, making for a very effective infantry squad."
5,"no, and neither is brazil's defense good enough to stop germany's offense."
5,"Wow these are some pretty harsh answers. I mean who are we to tell a Native American what offends them. I'm not Native American but I could see how a white guy dressed up in ""tribal"" clothes, running around and essentially mocking their culture, would be very offensive. I mean would we be allowed to have a team called the Blacks and have a mascot who runs around eating chicken and watermelon or dressed up in slave clothing? How offensive is that? Because it’s the same thing with Native Americans! Not to mention all the suffering their culture has gone threw in the past hundred or so years. I’m a huge Braves fan and I don’t personally see anything wrong with the tomahawk chop but if some Native Americans come forward and say that it is offensive I can definitely sympathize."
5,No they don't the IFC (international fighting commission) has the fighters tested before and after these guys step in the ring. UFC heavyweight champ Tim Sylvia was striped of his title after testing positive for use of steroids after his win in UFC 44  against Gan McGee. He was fined and suspended for a short period of time before winning the belt back in UFC 59.
5,"You are asking two questions.  The answer to the first question is easy -- Ronaldinho.\n\nThe second question is more complex.  Freddy Adu is a promising young talent, but he is a product of the overhyping Nike publicity machine.  There are many players near his age who are FAR better than him.  Anyone who puts Adu in the same class as someone like Lionel Messi is smoking something funny.  Cesc Fabregas is only 18.  Sergio Aguero is 17.  Wayne Rooney is not that much older than Adu.\n\nThere are many players in youth systems who are light years ahead of Adu.  Most Americans have never heard of Theo Walcott (he's 16), but believe me he is better than Adu. Adu isn't even the best young American (Giuseppe Rossi is 17 and was born in New Jersey).  I'm not saying Freddy isn't a good talent and a promising player, but let's keep things in perspective and not drink the Nike Kool-Aid."

5,"Serena has a muscular frame and is very powerfully built.  She can exchange heavy shots with any woman on tour.  Serena likes to hit heavy angled shots and make her opponents run to track down balls.  Serena is also fast in her movement of quick starts and stops.  Serena has acomplished just about everything you can in tennis.  She has won multiple grandslam titles, she has become the #1 tennis player in the world...the only thing she has not done was to maintain the longevity of continued excellence which would have placed her among the all-time greats.  She is still in that company, just not quite in the same career wise as Graf and Navratilova.  Serena has lost some interest in maintaining peak physical condition and being match tough.  She has many other interests including fashion, acting, and perhaps even starting a family.  I think Serena might try to make one more run on tour, but ultimately i think her other interests will lead her to try other things."

5,"Okay, the object, as you should know is to get the yellow ball over the net, and inside the lines. If you are playing 1 on 1, use the inside lines. if you are playing 2 on 2, then you have that extra area on the side to hit it in, the valley. You may want to start off just hitting the ball back and forth with your partner. But you want to follow through on your shots, at first just hitting it may seem like a good idea, but eventally you will suck. If you start off following through your shots (you will be bad at first) but you eventally will get better.\n\ncheck out the link for more info..."

5,"yes, they are worth it.  Track spikes to a sprinter are like racing flats to a cross country runner. \nUltimately, it depends on your running style and how comfortable you think you would feel running in lighter more flimsy shoes.  \nFrom my experience as a distance runner, racing flats helped me and my times did improve.  Yet this should be something to discuss with another sprinter or a coach.  You being a sprinter, there is a little more to consider, especially since some tracks actually have limitations on what length of spikes they allow.  Some tracks do not allow anything longer than 1/4 inch and some 3/16 inch...it varies and depends on what surface material of the track, ie. rubber, asphalt and so on.  \nAlso, which events do you run?  400m, 100m, relays, hurdles?  Although I do not know for certain, I'm pretty sure different events probably require different spikes.  \nAll in all, if you can afford spikes without it breaking you, then I think it's worth it. \n\ngood luck:)"
5,"NO  I do not think Barry has ever been suspended nor found guilty of any illegal substances in his body. I will guarantee you he has to pee in the bottle at regular intervals.

5,"STEP 1: Stand on the board with your rear foot placed on the tail and your front foot between the middle of your board and the front bolts.\nSTEP 2: Place the ball of your rear foot in the middle of the board so that when you push the tail down, the ball of your foot feels the pressure.\nSTEP 3: Place your front foot nearly straight across the board.\nSTEP 4: Practice pushing down as fast as you can with your back foot and putting all your weight on the tail. This is the initial motion of the trick.\nSTEP 5: Notice that the harder you push, the more your board wants to keep going up once the tail is on the ground. You will use that motion in the next step.\n\nSTEP 6: Strike the tail on the ground and jump off with your rear foot as you slide your front foot up the board (so your knee moves toward your chest).\n\nSTEP 7: Drag the side of your foot up the board as you are jumping. This will cause the board to come up with your jump. Once both feet are in the air, the board will seem to stick to them.\nSTEP 8: Come back down.\nTips & Warnings\n\nLearn this trick without rolling at first to get comfortable with the motions. Once you feel comfortable with the basics, you will be able to adapt to moving and going up or down things.\nThe hardest part is the timing of when to push down on the tail, when to jump, and how quickly to suck up your legs. The secret: It's all done at the same time. The faster you do it, the easier it becomes. Think about jumping off with one foot and sucking your legs up to your chest.\nSkateboarding is an inherently dangerous activity that can result in serious injury or death. We recommend that you seek proper training and equipment before attempting this activity."

5,"First, try to treat it before it has become chronic. Once it takes hold, it's really hard to get rid of it without long-term rest--as much as 6 months.\nOtherwise, here are some treatments that work:\nIce the elbow immediately after use.\nUse a tennis elbow band--the one I know works well is BandiT. I've used several and that one really is effective.\nDo stretching exercises. A good one is to put a reasonably thick rubber band around your fingers and stretch them outwards. Do various extension/flexion and pronation/supination exercises--see illustrations at the site below.\nEquipment--be sure that you don't have your racket strung too tightly. I dramtically decreased string tension when I was having a problem, and it made a huge difference. Also avoid extremes in grip sizes. Some also say that the racket material can make a difference as well as the racket head size. Sometimes just switching to another racket can help to give your elbow a rest.\nVery important--if your elbow problem is caused by poor mechanics, which often is the case, you really need to make corrections for long-term relief. Otherwise, each time your elbow recovers it will immediately get worse because of the stress due to poor technique. See a knowledgeable pro about this."

5,"I found it to be indicative of my impression of Bryant and the entire league's current style of play: taking a difficult path himself instead of giving the ball to a teammate for an easier play. I counted at least two viable options other than going over Nash. \nThat said, it was an amazing athletic display of superior leaping ability and strength... that had a decent chance of been called a charge if it wasn't the Lakers."
5,"Who can say, Rangers and Celtic are not in the top 5? They have among the most passionate rivalries in Europe if not the world. They play to full houses each week, I think Celtic Park can hold above 60000 and Ibrox (if they have done refurbishments) above 50000. Only Man Utd can top Celtic and Newcastle can match Rangers.\n\nTop 5:\nMan Utd\nCeltic\nRangers\nNewcastle\nChelsea (I think their capacity exceeds Anfield)"

5,"Yes Canada is better. One reason is there are ice rinks everywhere. They get so much ice time. Brother moved up there. Here in the US there is not much ice time for everyone to play. The other part is the style they play. Canadiens arent power players like the US but they can step up to it if they have too. US tries to use physical play in every aspect. Canada uses speed and finess, but if they need to play physical they can. If you go over to Russia and stuff, you hardly ever see hitting in the games. I think a lot of Canada's success can be based on fans compared to the US. A lot of US fans dont get the sport of hockey and all they want to see is hitting and fights. Canadien fans respect the game and love to see the skilled play and great team plays. I would have loved to play in Canada because of the style. I think Canada has the top style in the world and that is why they are the best. So yes they are much better than Americans, and a lot of good Americans play in Canada before going to the NHL as well."
5,"Most NASCRAP ""fans"" are from the bible belt in the US where the Southern Bastards - oops, Baptists - and fundamentalist christian cults both hold sway.  In those demented religions, their ""god"" doesn't hold them accountable for their actions, the only thing that matters is ""axseppin' jeezus into yer hart!""  Consequently, many of them don't feel any compunction for their actions and think anything they say or do is okay because ""I got my jeebus"".\n\nOnly a NASCRAP fan would shoot someone for wearing a particular hat into a bar.  \n\nhttp://www.owencounty.org/news/052102.htm\n\n""NASCAR is a bunch of farmers driving around in circles.""\n- Eddie Irvine, ex-F1 driver"

As long as they stay away from me I'm ok.  But if I had to get one off my line...I think I would cast, cut the line and let it fly.  Wouldn't care if it was my favorite lure."
5,"As a big guy myself (6'5"", 250lbs), I would suggest a solid framed mountain bike with a hard tail (no rear suspension.)  The rear suspension will bounce more and cause you to work harder.  I would recommend a front suspension, if you can find one in your price range, as it will increase the comfort.  Try looking in a discount sports store locally and see what they have to offer.  Your options will be limited by your price point but you may find something.\n\nAfter looking at the options, you might consider heading to a local bike shop to see if they know of anyone selling a pre-owned bike that would fit your needs.  Sometimes they will know of people trying to sell bikes.  They might even be able to put you on something that will work for a good price."
5,"Bound's hubby here:\n\nPersonally, I would avoid the new generation of Short Magnums, Super Short Magnums, and Ultra Magnums ... for two reasons ... first, the availability of ammo (especially near deer camps) and second, the designers intend these new rounds to replicate the performance of the original magnums in a shorter cartridge/action. \n\nI would strongly suggest a .30-06 Springfield or .270 WInchester for your hunt. With skill and practice, the .270 is sufficient gun for elk ... as long as the rifleman knows his limitations. The .30-06 should be the standard you go for. Any good rifle will do the job with the .30-06. Look for a Remington, Winchester, or Browning ... any of these rifles will be very reliable and affordable. Do not get cheap on a rifle and/or scope if this rifle will be either for a hunt of a life-time, or depended upon to put meat on the table for years to come!\n\nGood luck!"
5,"Boxing isn't all kids, but it would definitely help for some. I wouldn't start a kid out that's under eight years of age, but amateur boxing would:\n\n- help improve concentration\n- give the kid more confidence\n- work the kid out some, so he wouldn't be overactive later and would sleep better\n\nIf the kid has a trainer that focuses on the more skilled aspects of boxing, and teaches it as more of an art or science than as a contest of brute force, it could help the child develop analytical abilities.\n\nA lot of people are worried about children getting hurt, but it's actually very rare. The headgear and the large gloves that amateur fighters wear do a lot to protect them. Of course, your child should not be sparring until well trained in the basics of boxing and probably shouldn't enter any kind of competition for a year after starting out."

5,"The fact that there was an attempt of expanding into an american market was clever but I believe its was bad managemnet by the CFL. \nIf you are going to bring a product onto the market that people are used to seeing already (NFL) but change it a lil, its got to be 10 times better for it to survive. In the CFL's case they could not appeal to millions with their fast paced game.\nAmericans are used to their NFL/College 4-down style of football and I dont think that they were ready embrace it. Also look at it from the other points The NFL is a billion dollar league that operates and runs solely for the american people. Other leagues tried such as the XFL and some smaller leagues. Let's look at who has survived... only Arena Football.\nI personally dont think that it was a good idea for the CFL to have expanded into the US... rather they should of looked to secure their canadian markets i.e. (Victoria, Halifax, St. John's)... They needed to build around the country to form that regional claim to each team. \nIf you can't build a product in your own home why try elsewhere. Will you be successful?"
5,"Well, kind of. Stretching isn't going to strengthen your muscles.

5,"No , in fact they trained quite often together before Bruce died, and Joe often speaks quite favorably about Bruce due to their time together.\n\nIn fact Joe Lewis was voted twice (once in the U.S. and once in Europe) as the greatest fighter in the History of Karate And he did not die, the Joe Lewis I'm speaking about is a Veteran of the Vetnam war, and was already a reknowned kickboxer and Martial Artist before metting Bruce who apparently earned his Blackbelt in Shorin-Ryu in a mere 7 months while he was in Okinawa.\n\nHe has a book out (How to Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, I believe it's through O'Hara publications, they have it for sale online at awma.com) that outlines the times they spent, he didn't speak out for as much as 30yrs until recently, mostly because he didn't want to cause more problems with the rumors that were already swirling around shortly after Bruce's passing.\n\nJoe also makes regular apperences at the NAPMA World Conference in Clearwater, Florida (where he now lives) and often has an article in NAPMA's monthly magazine. I've attended 2 or 3 of the seminars he's held at the Conferences.\n\nI think the falling out you're referring to is the problems that occurred during the filming of Way of the Dragon, Which has never been proven.\n\nthe story goes that Joe was originally asked to be the main badguy Bruce's character fight's in the end of the movie called Colt, but in the end Chuck Norris was asked to be the villain instead."

5,"When I was in boot camp, our drill instructor (who happened to be a Colorado state high school wrestling champion) gave us a routine that worked great, worked quickly, and didn't require an investment in equipment. It did help to have a second person.\nThe routine requires one person to lay on their back with bottoms of their legs sitting up on a bench, like an ottoman.  \nNow, for two solid minutes, do as many sit-ups as you possibly can.  Try to hit eighty, (if you can, try to hit one hundred).  If there is a second person, they should be holding your legs.\nTake a break of three minutes.  Swap places if you are working out with someone. Let them do the two minute drill.  \nOn the next round, while back in the position, do ten sit-ups as slowly as you can.  Make it real slow.  Try to make it all the way up. \nCycle between those two routines three times.  Your stomach will tighten up in about ten days or so."

For how long depends on how you deal with cleaning up you credit.\n\nIf you pay the accounts without using a pay for delete agreement, they will just notate your reports as paid collections. Which will be just as bad as having the collection on your reports.\n\nIf you use a pay for delete agreement, when they delete the account your score will dip from losing the history of the account. But you scores will probably rebound sooner than having a paid collection. \n\nIf you are dealing with collection agency's, you should send a debt validation first. When they properly validate the debt (and you are still in SOL) send them a pay for delete letter. \n\nInclude in that letter that they will not only delete the tradeline they have placed on your reports, but they will also not sell the debt, sell the remainder of the debt (if you request to only pay a percentage of it - which you should request) and will not continue to collect the debt. (collection agency's have been known to do all of those - even when the debt is paid.) \n\nIf the debt is out of the statute of limitations (SOL) for your state, you have the right to ""not pay"" it. After you send the debt validation letter and you know it is out of SOL, you have the right to send them a SOL letter. And, if they are reporting incorrectly on your reports (which they probably are) you have the right to dispute the account with the credit bureaus. Requesting that the accounts are either corrected, or if not, deleted.\n\nI would also suggest trying to get a secured card or two. If you do that now, you would have a years history on it/them which will help you when you want to get that loan.  \n\nOnly use the cards occasionally for small amounts, a tank of gas etc. and pay in full when you get the statement.

6,"Earth's magnetic field (and the surface magnetic field) is approximately a magnetic dipole, with one pole near the geographic north pole and the other near the geographic south pole. An imaginary line joining the magnetic poles would be inclined by approximately 11.3° from the planet's axis of rotation. The cause of the field is probably explained by dynamo theory. The magnetic field extends several tens of thousands of kilometres into space as the magnetosphere\n\nThe locations of the magnetic poles are not static but wander as much as 15km every year (Dr. David P. Stern, emeritus Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA). The two poles wander independently of each other and are not at directly opposite positions on the globe. Currently the south magnetic pole is farther from the geographic south pole than the north magnetic pole is from the north geographic pole.\n\nThe field is similar to that of a bar magnet, but this similarity is superficial. The magnetic field of a bar magnet, or any other type of permanent magnet, is created by the coordinated motions of electrons (negatively charged particles) within iron atoms. The Earth's core, however, is hotter than 1043 K, the Curie point temperature at which the orientations of electron orbits within iron become randomized. Such randomization tends to cause the substance to lose its magnetic field. Therefore the Earth's magnetic field is caused not by magnetised iron deposits, but mostly by electric currents in the liquid outer core.\n\nAnother feature that distinguishes the Earth magnetically from a bar magnet is its magnetosphere. At large distances from the planet, this dominates the surface magnetic field.\n\nElectric currents induced in the ionosphere also generate magnetic fields. Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations which can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree.\n\nMagnetic field variations\n \nGeomagnetic variations since last reversal.The strength of the field at the Earth's surface ranges from less than 30 microteslas (0.3 gauss) in an area including most of South America and South Africa to over 60 microteslas (0.6 gauss) around the magnetic poles in northern Canada and south of Australia, and in part of Siberia.\n\nMagnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artefacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in geophysical survey. Using the magnetic instruments adapted from airborne devices developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. The basalt -- the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor -- contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nIn October 2003, the Earth's magnetosphere was hit by a solar flare causing a brief but intense geomagnetic storm, provoking unusual displays of aurorae.\n\nMagnetic field reversals\n\n\n\nMain article: geomagnetic reversal \nBased upon the study of lava formations in Hawaii, it has been deduced that the Earth's magnetic field reverses at intervals, ranging from tens of thousands to many millions of years, with an average interval of approximately 250,000 years. The last such event, called the Brunhes-Matuyama reversal, occurred some 780,000 years ago.\n\nThe mechanism responsible for geomagnetic reversals is not well understood. Some scientists have produced models for the core of the Earth wherein the magnetic field is only quasi-stable and the poles can spontan"

6,"In 2002 the firm voluntarily surrendered its firm licenses to practice as Certified Public Accountants in the U.S. as a result of prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice connected with the Enron scandal.\n\nOn June 15, 2002, Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice for shredding documents related to its audit of Enron. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not allow convicted felons to audit public companies, the firm agreed to surrender its licenses and its right to practice before the SEC on August 31.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously overturned Andersen's conviction due to flaws in the jury instructions. In the court's view, the instructions allowed the jury to convict Andersen without proving that the firm knew it broke the law or that there was a link to any official proceeding that prohibited the destruction of documents. The opinion was also highly skeptical of the government's definition of ""corrupt persuasion"" — persuasion with an improper purpose even without knowing an act is unlawful.\n\nDespite this ruling, it is highly unlikely Andersen will ever return as a viable business. The firm lost nearly all of its clients when it was indicted, and there are over 100 civil suits pending against the firm related to its audits of Enron and other companies. It began winding down its American operations after the indictment. From a high of 28,000 employees in the US and 85,000 worldwide, the firm is now down to around 200 based primarily in Chicago.

6,"Arabic is a language from the Semitic family.\nTradition wants that the Arab alphabeth was revealed to Ibrahim's (Abraham's) son Ismail after he had settled with his mother Hajar (Agar) in the valley of Bakkah, where he would have built with his father Ibrahim the Holy Ka'ba.\n\nWhen some people from the Arabic peninsula joined Hajar and Ismail, they gave birth to the family of the Quraysh, among whom the Prophet Muhammad was born, descending directly from Ismail.\nThe Arab language developed in beauty before the Prophet's birth: poetry was considered with the highest honor in the ""Arabia Felix""; there were annual competitions among poets and they were taken in great consideration in their society.\n\nThe Coranic revelation was something new in this scenery: the Prophet was illiterate (we say he was ""intellectually virgin"") but the Coranic verses smote the same poets for their beauty, gramatical perfection and harmony.\nAfter the Revelation, the arabic language and grammar was redefined basing on the Holy Qur'an.\n\nThis is what is now called ""classical Arabic"".\nClassical Arabic is no more in use in the Arab world, aside from achademic study: in fact most of the Arab people use many different dialects, which are far different from the Coranic Arab, and far different one from the other, except for the alphabeth they use and the general gramatical structure.\nOn the other side, as Muslims in the world are for the 83% non-Arab, they generally only use this language to recite the Coranic verses in their prayers, while they use their national language for every other task."

6,"Empowerment and Experience!\n\nMy kids have been managing their own money since the age of 4 or 5.  That is about the age that kids recognize money and some of its power.  Having the freedom to make decisions with their money that they have earned has empowered them.  They are confident and they make good choices with their money.  They are all teens now.\n\nWe live in such a consumer driven society--it is difficult to overcome such clever marketing.  \n\nFirst and foremost--My husband and I believe in setting the example we hope they will become. \n\n1.  Just say NO! at the store.  \n\nWe have always made them work for the money they get from us.  I never subcomb to the pleadings at the store--I tell them to use thier own money.\n\n2.  Establish a saving/giving/spending plan.  Make it a habbit.\n\nWe have a rule--save half, give 10%, spend the rest.  When they were little, it was difficult for them to save or even learn to wait to buy something. Now saving and giving is just as important to them as spending.  They each have checking accounts with debit cards as well as saving accounts or money market funds.\n\n3.  Do not bail them out of a tough situation. \n\n It is difficult to see kids suffer disappointment, but it is an opportunity for a great lesson.  My kids  have lost their money and made many painful mistakes--including making impulsive purchases that feel good at the time, but is a waste of their resources;  letting friends 'borrow' money--never to see it repaid. \n \n Our theory is that we'd rather have them make mistakes now and give them a chance to learn and establish good habbits by giving them as much experience as possible.  \n\nWe'd rather see our 8 year old lose his 40 dollars because of carelessness than to see our 28 year old lose 4000 dollars because of carelessness he could have learned to avoid when he was 8.  Wise people tend to learn from their mistakes.  \n\n4.  Teach them according to their personality. \n\nEach kid manages money differently, but we have taught them to work with the personality they have and not put themselves in difficult situations.  I have a kid that is an impulsive spender, who does not like to balance her checkbook.  So she puts away money (her paycheck) in a saving account (short term savings) and investments (long term savings) first and then gives herself a set amount of cash to spend every week.  Her rule is, she can spend whatever she puts in her wallet for the week on whatever she wants impusively but when the money is gone, she has to wait the next week for the next installment of money.  She does not use checks or her debit card. She uses her short term savings to pay cash for more expensive items and does not touch her investments--which she will use for college.  This keeps her from having to physically balance any checkbook--which she hates to do. My other kids are savers, but are very selective about what they purchase.  They treat themselves to things, sometimes sharing the cost (like a computer game or book).  \n\nOur son has come  a long way--losing the most money as a kid, by not keeping in a safe place or by being careless.  He is so much better at managing his money and and keeping things safe.  He has trained himself to put his valuable belongings in a 'home' he established.  He is really a messy kid and absent minded at times.  But his habbits has helped him overcome his short- comings.   \n\n\n5.  Real world education.   We are focusing on identity theft, carefully surveying offers to make wise decisions.  They are consumers and use the internet frequently.  My son has even been cheated on ebay--for $600.  Working through the horrible 6 month process of dealing with endless voice mail, poorly informed customer service agents, red tape and law enforcement  was a great lesson for him. He was very upset, thinking that he lost his money.  Fortunately he was able to get it back. He will be much more careful before making purchases and he "

Your strategy is to Buy a stock and sell it when it goes up $0.25. The same after selling it, sell it short (this is the exact opposite of buying, in this case you want the stock to go down) when it drops $0.25 unload it, and buy again, do this up and down thing as many times as possible.

Some nightmares can be caused by certain drugs or medications, or by rapid withdrawal from them, or by physical conditions such as illness and fever. The nightmares of early childhood likely reflect the struggle to learn to deal with normal childhood fears and problems. Many people experience nightmares after they have suffered a traumatic event, such as surgery, the loss of a loved one, an assault or a severe accident. The nightmares of combat veterans fall into this category. The content of these nightmares is typically directly related to the traumatic event and the nightmares often occur over and over. Other people experience nightmares when they are undergoing stress in their waking lives, such as difficulty or change on the job or with a loved one, moving, pregnancy, financial concerns, etc. Finally, some people experience frequent nightmares that seem unrelated to their waking lives. These people tend to be more creative, sensitive, trusting and emotional than average. \n\nIf you want more info go to http://www.asdreams.org/nightma.htm more info."

Conversely, you can also buy a lifecycle fund that will retire in 2010.

It could be that title company messed up the loan documents and the lender will not release the funds until all required documents are signed properly, with correct dates and such. See about contacting the lender directly if you are dealing with a broker before you contact anyone else. Some lenders that deal with brokers are not licensed to speak to borrowers but if you speak with a branch manager or someone else higher in the organization you may get some better answers. I used to work for a lender just like that. You are more than welcome to contact me for further information about the process flow. \n\nAlso, there are Federal regulations in place that require a lender to fund a loan in a certain time frame once the loan documents have been signed and the lender may have required title to get the documents re-signed to ensure they are still in compliance with those regulations. You can contact your states consumer affairs division to find out what your rights are as well as the federal governments' consumer affairs division!!!"

We clearly state our policy in the materials you were sent.  We also include a phone number and an email address useful to stopping this automatic payment procedure if you decide so to do.  I just tried this number and it only took a couple of minutes on hold before I was able to speak with a customer service agent. We would hope that you will continue to nurture your dream of making more money and would hope that you will see us as the solution in the future.

6,"Oh wow - that is so sad.  I am really sorry that you have gone through SOOOO much in this recent past.  I am sure it must feel like your world has just about crushed in around you.  :(  \n\nI can really see now why you wish you could just have it all be over with.  What you are feeling is completely normal.  I wish there was a quick fix for the way you were - but there really isn't.  :(   \n\nOne thing that you may or may not be into doing is this -  exercise... I know that you may not want to at this time - but it really is good for you - it elevates the endorphins which in turn helps to elevate your mood.  So while it won't make everything better - it can help you to cope with it a bit better than you might be right now.  \n\nI will keep you in my prayers tonight and pray for that ""hole"" in your heart to be healed and filled with the Love of God.  I had that ""hole"" at one point in my life... It is lonely and sad - it makes you feel like you just have no reason to exist... ""what is the point of it all"" I would ask my self all the time.  But I have survived that time.  Life has improved and I have seen the blessings of the Lord in my life. If I had died or never existed I would have never known what I know now -  I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason - both good and bad things.  We Learn from the bad in order to be able to help others to the other side... to be a shoulder to cry on - or to gain wisdom through it.  \n\nKeep truckin' along - you will get to a better place - it may take a long time - but you will get there.  Keep your eyes on the blue sky and try to look at positive things in life.  I know they may seem like few and far between, but they are there... take the moment to look at the beautiful pink or yellow blossom as it blooms into the new spring of this year.  Take the time to look at the white fluff clouds as they float around the blue sky and a lady bug lands on the leaf - or a butterfly flutters by.  Take joy in these small things... small improvements will help you.  \n\nWhen you have negative feelings try your hardest to push them out and possibly pray at that time if you have a relationship with God.  Ask for help and peace in this difficult time.  \n\nyou will be happy one day Hiedi23\n♥"

6,"Sandblasting is the process of using compressed air to propel abrasive media at a surface to clean, (usually paint & rust),debur, or to prepare a surface for a coating of some sort.\nThere are two kinds of sandblasters: ""Suction"" / ""Siphon"""" & ""Pressure"" Blast Systems\nPressure systems are 10 TIMES Faster & much more effective, but also quite a bit more expensive.\nThere are (2) basic kinds of blasters: Blast Cabinets & Portable Blasters\nThere is a huge variety of abrasive blast media out there each has its purpose. One you want to stay away from is Silica Sand. Blasting with Silica sand causes Silicosis of the lungs...Do Not Ever Use It!!!\nIf you are looking to blast hand tools, such as saw blades, wrenches, etc., I'd recommend blasting them in a sandblast cabinet. (A ""Suction/Siphon"" cabinet would probably be sufficient...)\nSandblast Cabinets have adequate lighting, a dust collector, and two gloves you place you hands inside to blast within the cabinet. One nice part about blasting inside a cabinet is that all the dust is contained, so no respirator is needed. They are also relatively quiet, and some have abrasive separators which allow you to get the maximum life out of the abrasive blast media & consequently save money.\nSteps involved in ""blasting"" inside a cabinet:\n1) Open Door\n2) Place Item inside\n3) Close Door\n3) Turn On The Power\n5) Place Your Hands Inside The Gloves\n6) Grab The Blast Hose, or Suction Gun\n7) Step On The Foot Pedal\n8) Blast Surface\n9) Blow-Off Item with Blow-Off Nozzle (Inside Cabinet)\n10) Inspect\n11) Repeat Blast If Needed\n12) Open Door\n13) Remove Item"

6,"I agree with spade_2nite, something doesn't sound right if they are contacting you for payment - if they had recieved a judgment.\n\n\nContact your county court clerk and ask if there is a judgment or a suit filed in your name. (You can also go to the clerks office and request to see your file.)\n\nIf there is no judgment or pending suit filed, that company is violating your rights. If that is the case - speak with an attorney immediately!!!\n \nIf there is a judgment filed and you had been properly served, check your state statutes for the exemptions in your state.\nFor example -  exemptions ""may"" mean that they cannot garnish your wages, take your car, take funds from your bank account etc. It all depends on ""your"" states exemption laws. \n\nAfter you check with your county court clerk and find that there is or is not a judgment against you, it may be best to speak with an attorney. There are many attorneys that will give a free first consult   \n\nAlso, I would suggest purchasing a tape recorder and the next time they call, tell them that you are recording the call. Some states allow you to tape without informing the other party that you are taping, you would have to check your state laws on that. But, if you cannot find your states laws on taping, then be sure to inform them you are taping when they call.  \n\nTell them that recieving phone calls at your home and place of employment is inconvenient for you and that you are requesting they contact you by the U.S. postal service only - be sure to have that on tape. By law, if you tell them to cease calling - they are ""required"" to stop calling.\n\nIf there is a judgment against you, filing for bankruptcy may not be the wisest thing to do - depending on the dollar amount of the judgment and your other debts. \n\n\nI have included a link so you can check your states rules of service"

It's good to remember that we should judge what God's Law is very carefully, for example God's word has been changed continually in CHristianity through centuries.   \n \nNow, every case is different, but I would answer you like this: \nGod is great and merciful so He gives more time (chances) for ""rotten"" people to rethink and change.

6,"Whoever answers this question, will give you the broker that they have settled on and now use. But their criteria are different than yours, and you don't tell us what yours are.\n\nAre you trading stocks, commodities, futures, options, or all of these? If the latter, TerraNova is the only one that you can trade everything, real time, online, direct access. A lot of online brokerages claim to give you direct access, but if they take more than a second to execute your trade, it aint direct.\n\nFind the articles online that have evaluated and compared online brokerages. I found a good one online in Barron's, but you'll find others in the trading magazines. \n\nThis is worth putting a little time and effort into, because it's a pain to switch, so once you choose, you're kinda stuck with it. \n\nTownsend Electronics, the Parent company of TerraNova, is the one that digitized and electronified the Nasdaq. They are technological industry leaders and have a powerful and well built trading system. \n\nI use RealTick at TerraNovaOnline, but it costs $275/mo, even though it is unlimited what you can do with it. I think the Investor package is free to use, and just uses one screen. \n\nWhat you should try is a free trial of their Investor platform, which is free. You only get one window to trade from, but hey, with $5,000-how many stocks are you going to watch? Their rates are good also, but of course, it depends on how often you trade. It will take you months to learn all the bells and whistles of what this program can do.\n\nThe other top-of-the line program is TradeStation, but it costs big bucks to join and operate. Some people consider it the Cadillac of trading and technical analysis. \n\nTerraNova is the home of the Day Trader, so they think nothing of you making several hundred trades a day. You don't have to do that, but it's okay here if you do."
6,"Help a lot of people while you earn next to nothing for the rest of your life.  I don't mean that in a mean way!  It is simply the truth.  For some reason our society seems to value all the wrong things.  Think about it teachers, social workers, nursing home attendants are ALL grossly underpaid.  We trust our children, our families, and our elderly to people who barely make a living wage.  What's that about?  Your degree tells me you care about PEOPLE more than high wages.  Good for you!  Get ready to be mocked and looked down upon by most people.  Be prepared to drive an older car and live in a smaller house.  Be prepared to lay awake at night worrying about people most of your neighbors would simply throw away.  Get ready for a lifetime of disappointment and every once in a great while get ready for a miracle.  Not often, but sometimes when you most need it a kid will surprise you and turn out OK.  Cherish those victories.  Know that the rich that mock you haven't half the heart you do.  At the end of your life you may not have a lot of money to count, but you can count your blessings instead.  Good luck...you'll need it!"

Still, without actually seeing how your computer is acting or responding, it's hard to make the most accurate diagnosis.\n\nBTW, here's an odd ""fix"" I experienced from when my stepson bought and tried to load ""Medal of Honor: Allied Assault""... it said it loaded, but never played. We went back to the store (Target, just for reference) and traded it in on another copy of the same game. Took that home and re-loaded it, and it's worked fine ever since.\n\nI can't guarantee you'll have the same luck, but it might be worth a shot. You could just have a flawed CD copy of the game."
6,"Haircut\n1. The difference between prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security. \n\n2. The percentage by which an asset's market value is reduced for the purpose of calculating capital requirement, margin, and collateral levels.\n\nNotes:\n1. The term haircut comes from the fact that market makers can trade at such a thin spread. \n\n2. When they are used as collateral, securities will generally be devalued since a cushion is required by the lending parties in case the market value falls."

6,"A reverse mortgage (known as equity withdrawal in the United Kingdom) is a type of loan available to older people, used as a way of converting their home equity (the value of the home, minus the amount of mortgages) into cash payments while retaining ownership of the property. To qualify for a reverse mortgage in the United States, the borrower must be at least 62 and be able to pay off an existing mortgage with the proceeds from the reverse mortgage and if needed, additional personal funds. The amount any individual homeowner is eligible for depends on their age, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) appraised value of the home and the starting rate effective upon closing. The location of the home may also have an impact.\n\nReverse mortgages allow the home owner to continue living in the home, and allows repayment of the loan to be deferred until the borrower is no longer living in the home. In the United States, the proceeds of the loan are tax-free, there are no minimum income requirements, and for most reverse mortgages, the money can be used for any purpose.\n\nIncome and credit ratings are not considered by lenders when granting reverse mortgages, notwithstanding a bankruptcy that has not been resolved. The majority of reverse mortgages are FHA insured.\n\nIn a reverse mortgage in the U.S., a borrower can be paid in a lump sum, in monthly advances (payments), through a growing line of credit, or a combination of all three. The loan advances are not taxable and do not affect Social Security or Medicare benefits, although Medicaid and SSI benefits may be impacted. The cost of a reverse mortgage exceeds the costs of other types of loans. However, in some cases the costs may be less than or the same as the cost of selling a home and moving.\n\nSee a lender/mortgage company. Be careful! This type of mortgage is NOT for everyone.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mortgage"

6,"Whistle-blowing is fine and should be encouraged.  If the employer retaliates, be prepared for a lawsuit against them.  If it's not a serious whistle-blower case, and just an annoying peer, then you have options.  First, confront that person with the consent and acknowledgement of other people, preferrably a manager if possible.  This is to avoid any ungrounded allegations.  Do it with witnesses.  If that doesn't work, be more strategic and put them in a situation where you know they will be tempted to tattle, and when they run to tell, be sure that you did not do what they thought you did, and be able to prove it.  This way you have a chance at discrediting that person.  Generally it's best, however, not to sink to their level, as a tattle tale will usually destroy themselves eventually."

6,"It is hard to find grants to start a business -- whether for single moms or intact families. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

6,"If you are on a salary, your employer will withhold taxes from your paycheck. This is actually you paying taxes. When you file your tax return, you are reconciling the amount of taxes you have paid against the actual amount owed. If not enough was withheld, you will owe taxes. If too much is owed, you may also owe interest and penalties, so you want to make sure your withholding are reasonable so that you basically cover all your taxes owed. If you have paid too much, you get a refund, but getting a large refund doesn't mean you have hit the lottery. It means you have been having too much withheld from your check and you have made an interest-free loan to the government. Your goal should be to get back or owe no more than about $100. When you start a job, you have to fill out federal and state tax withholding forms, which explain how to calculate a reasonable number of exemptions. You can also change these at any time, if your circumstances change, like you take a second job, you get married, you have a child, etc. If you don't know what you are doing, ask a tax professional to help you figure it out.\n\nNow, as for when to file your taxes. Do your tax return as soon as you get all the information you need (W2s, 1099s, etc.). If you are getting a refund, file right away. If you owe (but not enough to owe a penalty) wait and file close to April 15. If you owe with a penalty, pay as soon as possible, since the interest will keep accruing.\n\nHope that helps."

6,"In our website, we sell advertising space - both banners via CPM, sponsored text links, and newsletter advertising. In our experience, here are what advertisers are looking for when choosing sites to use for their advertising:\n\n1. Who are the visitors = It is important for advertisers to know whether your site's visitors are what they are after. More than just traffic numbers, they want to know whether they can get targeted traffic from your website. They want to know whether the customers they want are visiting your site.\n\n2. Traffic levels = Advertisers will often ask you how many visitors/pageviews/uniques you get in a month. Some will go to Alexa.com to check your traffic standing (not accurate, but many see it as a good guide). If you are selling banners through CPM rates for example, they will normally ask you how long it will take you to show the 20,000 ad impressions they ordered (or how many they ordered).\n\n3. Your rates = how comparable your rates are with others.\n\n4. Customer service = advertisers want QUICK support from sites they want to advertise on. You need to be quick to respond to their emails, whether inquiring for your media kit or asking your ad rates or checking the performance of their ad campaigns.The key to understand is that advertisers will always look for metrics to help them gauge the ROI they can get from advertising in your website. If they don't think your site will not give them a good ROI, they will not advertise or renew their advertising on your site\n\n5. Monitor campaign performance = advertisers want to see how their campaigns are doing on your site, so they can make decisions fairly quickly whether to change the creative, pause the campaign or increase the campaign. You need to be able to provide them with real time statistics. We use phpadsnew and it is just great (and FREE!).\n\nAs to what rate to charge, the amount depends on a number of factors:\n\n- Who is your audience and how desirable is your audience to the advertisers? If your audience are techies or those who have the propensity to purchase higher-ticket items, then you can charge a higher price as compared to an audience of students.\n\n- What is the rate of comparative websites in your niche? You don't want to overprice yourself out of the market yet you don't want to undercharge as well\n\n- What is the rate advertisers are willing to pay in your site? You may charge $5 per CPM and yet for months nobody's taking you on the rate even though you may get inquiries -- this implies that advertisers think your rate is too expensive. But if you charge $0.50 per CPM and advertisers are flooding in, then you may be too cheap and can afford to increase your rate.\n\n- What is the CPM you get from other advertising vehicles? Do you run Google Adsense, and if so, what is your effective CPM rate with them? Or if you run banner ads through ad networks like Burst Media, Valueclick or Tribal Fusion, what is the CPM you're getting? You can use those values to help you gauge your rate.\n\nSince you're just starting in the game, experiment and see what rate the market will bite. You can start at $1 per CPM and see how it goes.\n\nIn terms of accepting payment, majority (99.8%) of those who will advertise will pay by credit card so make sure you have your own merchant account as well as Paypal."

Then you should be able to flag the address as ""ok"", so future messages will go to your main mail folder.\n\n   It is different for every ISP, so you will have to check their help page to find out how yours works.\n\n   The other possibility is if the file has an attachment, it may be too large for your ISP to accept, or there might be virus software on your computer or on the ISP that rejects files with certain attachements to guard against viruses and worms.\n\n   Hope this helps!"

6,"Q. Why is my Tattoo Peeling and Flaking Off?\nFrom Karen Hudson,\nYour Guide to Tattoos / Body Piercings.\nFREE Newsletter. Sign Up Now!\nA.\nPeeling and flaking of a new tattoo is perfectly normal. Before it actually begins to peel, the tattoo will look like it's covered with a whitish, cracking film. Then you'll see white or translucent flakes of old, dead skin start to peel off and some of the flakes may even contain some ink. Sometimes you can actually see a duplicate image of part of your tattoo peeling off - it's rather disconcerting, but it is also perfectly normal and there is no need to panic. It's a lot like a snake shedding its skin. Just add a little lotion (a LITTLE) to the tattoo to help keep it moist and encourage those flakes to come off. Do NOT scratch, pick or peel them. It will all be done in a few days and the color of your tattoo will start to return to normal."

6,"First of all the extension of the original CAPM(Sharpe, Mossin,\nLintner in 1963) is termed the International CAPM or ICAPM.\nTo use it in china you need a beta for the stock or for a portolio of \nstocks which will be difficult for some of the newly formed \nChinese publically traded corporations.  Another factor is the\nstock market in China is an emerging market hence it suffers from a general lack of history and liquidity though expectation is that it will grow rapidly in the future.  \n\nThe model would be:R stock = risk free rate+Beta (Rmarket-RF)\n\n  Now in the literature it is common to use either the \nU.S. Treasury Bill Rate or the U.S. Long Bond Rate. As \nRoll's critique aptly pointed out there is no truely riskless asset\nso we have used the above surrogates. Not a bad choice though since the data on them is readily available through the U.S. \nFederal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury which issues these debt \nobligations through the Fed has never defaulted on any obligations.  Further the marke is the largest most liquid debt \nmarket in the world which has investors from around the world and foreign governments buying and selling these assets \ncontinuously.   \n\nSo, next we address the matter of a market index surrogate\nto use in the right hand terms.  Since we can't really use the \nChinese swtock market Index as a true surrogate for the \nworld market index we must make one.  Assuming there is \nadequate capital market integration today to allow us to do so.\nIn the literature some have use a weighted average composite\nconsisting ofweights determined by the relative market values \nof equity traded on the diverse major wold bourses(Stock Markets).  For example the portion of equity traded in the NY\nStock market weighted by an index like the S& P 500 index\nalong with the proportion of stocks traded in London weighted \nby the FTS Index.  Gradually if you consider all the major \nmarkets today such as Tokyo, Paris, London, New York,\nCanada TSE, etc.,\nyou'll be able to compute a suitable weighted average \nRORmrkt. \n\nThe major problem you need to ovwercome in any emerging market like China is thin market trading--translation too few stocks are quoted and trading activity in them takwes too long to \nprovide investors /money managers with enough information\nderived from each successive buy-sell combination). \n\n\n  Assuming you did find an adequately traded stock with enough \nhistory in the Chinese stock market, and you did compute a \nworld market index surrogate for the market index along \nwith selecting a risk free asset such as by using the U.S. \nT Bill Yield, then you could use the equation to correctly \nprice the Chinese stock in terms of its rate of return.\n\nAssume further that you average the returns on the world market\nindexes and it turns out to be 12%.\n\nNext regress the Chinese stock past returns (having converted from Yen capital gains and dividends) againtst the historical \nworld market stock index levels for the same number of observations as you have on the Chinese stock (note: the data \nmust be aligned so that they are matched for the same time periods as those of the Chinese stock'sprice observations. \nIn other words the matched pairs must be contemperaneous with one another. You should use say weekly, monthly close \ndata and with the problem I described earlier I would use the \nlater time interval for obserfvations.  \n\nThe coefficient of this OLS simple regression is the Beta\non the stock.  Assume it is 1.5 positive.\n\n    If we assume a yield on the U.S. T Bill of 5%, the math \nthen is  Stock ROR% = 5% + 1.5(10%-5%) = 5%+7.5%= 12%\n\nThere's the heart of your paper...now gety busy and write it.\n\nTry doing a dogpile or other search for academic journal, textbooks on international finance, and other sources."

So, you could refinance, with you as the primary borrower and this other person as the co borrower, and therefore jointly assume the debt.  Also, if you are married, I am nearly positive that Florida is a community property state, meaning, that even if your spouse is not on the loan to your home, if they live in it they own half."

6,"How to become an Actuary \nThe Society of Actuaries in Ireland is not itself an examining body. Most members qualify through the professional examinations of the Institute of Actuaries or the Faculty of Actuaries, both of which are United Kingdom bodies. The minimum entry requirements of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are:\n\n・Grade A1 or A2 in Honours Mathematics at the Leaving Certificate and pass in a least four other subjects including English \n\nOR\n\n・A first or second class degree in any subject, together with at least a Grade C in Honours Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate or such other standard in mathematics as the Councils consider to be equivalent.\n\nOR\n\n・To have studied mathematical sciences as a major subject as part of an honours degree course and gained at least third class honours in that degree.\n\nOR\n\n・Other certificates, diplomas or qualifications which the Councils consider to be equivalent to the above. \n\nThe above describe minimum standards for entry and it is readily observed that those completing the examinations have, in practice, a very good Leaving Certificate (near maximum points) and/or a strong degree in a mathematics related subject. The Society requests that anyone giving serious thought to a career as an actuary should have an informal chat with a qualified actuary. If you don稚 know an actuary then please contact the Society who will put you in touch with an actuary who will be delighted to help.\n\nExaminations are taken when the candidate chooses and there are two sittings each year. It takes an average of seven years to qualify (given the candidate has no more than a couple of exemptions) for those that qualify and, on balance, only half of those admitted as students actually qualify. \n\nThe qualification is fully recognised internationally."

It buys shorterm corporate debt, and gets you about 5.35 to 6% interest.\n\nXLACX or Highland Floating Rate Advantage class C is the best choice.

It appears that your only product line is term insurance so you say that that is the only type of insurance that makes sense for anyone.  That is simply wrong.  Every person has a different financial situation and until they have reviewed their situation and established a plan, you can not say that.  For many people a combination of term and permanent coverage is their best bet."

Which means before anything could be sold it would have to be signed by any heirs. Usually the only time it goes to the government is for expenses. For instance if the person was in a state home or something. It's an odd situation. However, most likely you're looking at heir property, which will sit there."

6,"Starting a small business takes a lot of courage. But, as they say, courage does not pay the bills. To be successful – to stay in business – you need more than courage. You need a combination of hard work, skill, perseverance, and lots of luck. \n\nSome things you need to consider:\n- ""How can I support my family while I build up by business?"" \n- ""What are my abilities?"" \n- ""Is there a market for the product or service I have chosen?"" \n- ""How long will it take this business to reach the financial goal I have?"" \n\nYou may want to read the article ""How to Start a New Business Successfully"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol51/launch.htm , which lists six steps to launch a new business successfully:\n\n1. Provide a benefit.\n2. Determine the fit with your market.\n3. Right timing is everything\n4. Be ready to support your business\n5. Develop a blueprint for success\n6. Market, market, market\n\nI suggest you read the article ""10 Things You Need to Know When Starting Your Own Small Business"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/startingbiz.htm which lists the important things you need to know when you are starting a business. \n\nI recommend that you read the following books:\n\n- What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business : Real Life Start-Up Advice from 101 Successful Entrepreneurs \n- Starting From Scratch: How To Start A Business When You Don't Have Money \n- If You're Clueless About Starting Your Own Business and Want to Know More \n- On the Move : How to Succeed and Survive As an Entrepreneur \n- How to Make 1000 Mistakes in Business and Still Succeed\n\nTo market your product, here are some tips:\n\n1. Direct mail. Prepare a well-crafted brochure and send it to your target markets in Sunnyvale. Find a vendor in your area renting mailing lists of business establishments or take the time and go over the yellow pages and get their contact information. You can read more of how to use direct marketing strategies here http://www.powerhomebiz.com/marketing/direct.htm\n\n2. Publicity. Publicity can oftentimes be more effective than advertising. Not only is it cost-effective (oftentimes you are paying for nothing), but also people are apt to remember an article about your business rather than advertising. People find a write-up or special feature about a business more credible and objective than a paid advertising. Publicity also reaches a wider audience: if you are lucky, the national media might even pick up your story. Contact an editor of your local newspaper and pitch your story. Read the article ""Leverage the Power of Publicity for Your Small Business"" \nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol27/leverage.htm\n\n3. Press releases. Send out press releases through your local newspapers about your business. Whether it is about your story or about a sale you are offering, press releases can be very good exposure for you. You can read more about how to harness press releases for your business here http://www.powerhomebiz.com/marketing/public%20relations.htm\n\n4. Use the Internet. The Web can be your online brochure. You can use it to refer your potential clients for more information about your business; and it could also generate clients for you directly. Some of your potential clients may be looking to the Web for a floral designer, and you need to have a strong presence there as well.\n\n5. Network. Join and be active in your local business organizations, chamber of commerce, etc. Increase your visibility in the community. You can find more information on networking here http://www.powerhomebiz.com/marketing/networking.htm\n\n6. Word of mouth. This is the best form of advertising for your business - afterall, it is free. Read ""Secrets of Word Of Mouth Marketing"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol154/wordofmouth.htm"

6,"i'm not sure if a floor plan of an existing building would be that easy to obtain. try maybe the city office in your area i'm not sure exactly what department but certainly they have that documents. if that's not possible ask architecture students,if you know someone, they usually have plates/blueprints of some sorts in their portfolio, if your lucky they may have what you're looking for. this could be as good because they follow certain specifications and requirements in their plates the only problem is that these are floor plans of nonexisting structures, there maybe certain errors or problems but it's not like you'll be building the structure or anything, it'll be good enough since you'll just be needing the layout."

6,It depends on what agency he used to pull your credit. Some creditors only report to certain bureaus. maybe they'll report to equifax and not transunion. If could be that the creditors you have may have only reported to two of the three agencys. Highly unlikely but possible. Tell your guy to use CreditPlus. That's who I use. I'm a mortgage guy too. Basically it costs money to report you to the bureaus. so if your creditors are cheap than it may just be that they only reported you to the cheaper bureaus and not all of them. Most credit cards will report you to all three bureaus but some smaller ones will only report you to some.
6,"Deffinatly. Opposites attract. We always look for someone to complete ourselfs. No one wats to live with someone who is exactly identical with him. Although there has to be some common points, like a common hobby for example. Difference is exciting and keeps a relation interesting and full of surprises. I think that they key in building a succesful relations betwen 2 opposite people is their ability to comunicate and compromise. \n2 opposites make a balance and equilibrium. As yin and yang, the chinesse concept which describes two primal opposing but complementary forces found in all things in the universe. Yin, the darker element, is passive, dark, feminine, downward-seeking, and corresponds to the night; yang, the brighter element, is active, light, masculine, upward-seeking and corresponds to the day.\nSome of the yin and yang principals are:\n1. Yin and Yang are opposites\nEverything has its opposite—although this is never absolute, only comparative. No one thing is completely yin or completely yang. Each contains the seed of its opposite. For example, winter can turn into summer; ""what goes up must come down"".\n\n2. Yin and yang are interdependent.\nOne cannot exist without the other. For example, day cannot exist without night.\n\n3.4. Yin and yang consume and support each other.\n\nYin and yang are usually held in balance—as one increases, the other decreases. However, imbalances can occur. They can again be seen as a pair."

They are not risking much. They have a $250,000 property that they are using as collateral for a $40,000 loan. If the loan has to be foreclosed (you do not make the payments), the bank will be able to sell the property for enough to pay the loan and any and all costs."

6,"Actually he never invented electricity he discovered and proved that a lightning storm is composed of electricity and led to breakthroughs by others in harnassing it. As for why he should be there most probably because of his immense contribution. He was the oldest statesman in his time, a renaissance man with multiple accomplishments as a scientists, who invented such gadgets as the bifocals, as a statesmen who represented the fledgling America in France and to ensure an alliance for France to go to war against England when it needed it most as well as to secure funds for the war. He was also the first few to propose secession and help in  convening the colonial governments to meet and agree to declare independence. His work as a printer as well also helped in spreading ther evolutionary word and in exposing the injustice the crown was imposing on the colony and though unsuccessful his efforts in England in representation of the colonies were equally important. All due he did more than any president to ensure the Americas would one day grow to its present state and prosper. Thus should he appear on the 100 dollar bill."
6,"I suppose it is possible that a tax increase could reduce research and development in some industries.

6,"It doesn't matter where you reside, look at the areas surrounding your immediate cities and other surrounding areas.  \n\nI find that purchasing raw land 10-15 miles outside a city normally works really well and is the land is cheap in most instances.  \n\nDepending on how much you have to invest and the cost of land near where you live. Try and buy the minimum of 4-5 acres. A good size property to purchase if you are a small time investor as I am would be 10-20 acres, developers will purchase those type all the time for single family homes.  Make sure that you get from the county the zoning of the property. That should not really concern you as you are planning to sell it anyway.\n\nDon't be concerned if utilities are not built to your property as of yet, eventually the city will build the utilities out to where you are. You must continue to pay property taxes on the property and any improvement tax assessed by the city. If they build the utilities out and past your property, you could be accessed a utility tax, sometimes this is a one time tax, other times it is done over a few years depending on how the local govenrment vote on the payment.\n\nI find this to be an excellent way to build a trust for my grandchildren's education.\n\nYou will find that being a land speculator is a good business and not only that but profitable. As you gain more experience you can and would want to go out further, bank the land. I try and sell about 10-20 acres per year or more. I try to purchase about 50-60 acres per year.\n\nI don't know if there are any land properties in your area but try this site they sell land and the sign up is free. they also have a booklet you can receive in the mail.\n\nYou should always look at a piece of land before buying it.\n\nwww.landauction.com\n\n \nI hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.\n\n""FIGHT ON"""

There will be lots of good years and a few bad years before you retire.  The returns in the good years will outweigh the returns in the bad years, and in the long run you should outperform the safer portfolio.\n\nYou should probably put your money in a well diversified fund that mimics a broad stock market nidex -- like the S&P 500.

Most frequently eviction consists of ousting a tenant who has breached the terms of a lease or rental agreement by not paying rent or a tenant who has stayed (held over) after the term of the lease has expired or only had a month-to-month tenancy. \nHowever an owner of  real property can be evicted from his/her property either by:  legal action (suit for unlawful detainer), a claim of superior (actual) title to the property, or actions which prevent the tenant or owner from continuing in possession (constructive eviction)."

Then, once you're approved, they will send you a credit card. Your credit line will be the same amount as your deposit. It looks and works just like any other credit card when you use it at a restaurant or store. \n\nYour deposit is used to open a savings account which assures your credit card can be paid. The money in your savings account is there to ""secure"" your credit line. The money in your savings account is FDIC insured and won't be touched as long as you make all of your credit card payments on time and your account remains open. Plus, you will earn interest on the money in your savings account. \n\nYour purchases are billed to you each month. Payments are not automatically deducted from your savings account.

Does this sound too good to be true ? Well it is !! I received a similar E-mail, and probably thousands of other people got that message as well. This is almost certainly an attempt at internet fraud, and it is probably a variation of the very successful Nigerian 419 scam, i.e. ""We will send you six million dollars, but first you need to send us a few thousand dollars for taxes and attorney's fees.""

Under that theory, new information is not helpful because the stock price will already reflect that information by the time you read it.\n\nOn the other hand, for general investment advice, strategic long-term plans and other such things, information can be extremely helpful.

6,"Suggestions For Building Your Subscription Business\n\nAs an Independent agent of  , your opportunities are unlimited to build your subscription business. As an agent, you are authorized to use magazine covers in any of your own promotional material. You are allowed to market your business any way that you want. Here are a few suggestions to help build your business.\n\n\n(1) Think large for the long term, but think small in the beginning. Start your business by contacting people that you know ( friends, family, neighbors etc. ). Let these people know that you are in business, and explain to them what a convenient service you provide. Sample promotional letters are available upon request. For example:  Since the average household takes approximately six magazine subscriptions, by ordering and renewing through you, they would only have to write one check, one time, to you, for all of their subscription needs. The customer also does not have to deal with any customer service issues, so if there is a problem, you can handle it for them (by contacting our office ).\n\n(2) Network your subscription business as a fund-raiser. Contact local schools, churches, civic groups etc. who want to raise money for their organization and keep a percentage of sales as your profit.\n\n(3) Take advantage of any gift giving occasion ( holidays, birthdays, engagements, graduations, etc.) Keep a log of all special occasions for your customers. For example:\nWhen it is the birthday of the mother of your customer, contact the customer and suggest a subscription as a gift. Not only will your customer had not thought of previously. Again, you are providing a service and your customer will probably be glad that you called and made the suggestion.\n\n(4) Contact local business who having waiting areas (family doctor, pediatrician, dentist, beautician, mechanics etc.) More than likely, these offices have someone who is designated to handle magazine renewals in addition to their other job responsibilities. This is an excellent opportunity for you to offer your service at little or no additional cost to the customer.\n\n\n(5) Ask existing customers for referrals. Most businesses get their start this way. For example: Your beautician built his or her client base from referrals of existing customers. Word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertisement.\n\n(6) Contact your local Chamber of Commerce to get a listing of businesses ( and their address / Phone Number) in your area. Write a letter of introduction, or use our suggested letter of introduction, to contact them. There may be a small fee to get this list.\n\n(7) Contact large businesses in your area. These employees not only have reception areas, but the management staff usually receive a variety of subscriptions.\n(8) Keep updates on new residents in your area. Write a letter to welcome them to the community and tell them about your service. Form a business relationship with a local company that deals with major purchases ( real estate brokers, car salesman ). Suggest that they give a gift subscription to any new customer who makes a purchase. If you deal with a real estate broker, you will know who the new residents in the community are, and you can contact them for other subscription business.\n\n(9) Build relationships with your customers. Follow up with existing customers on a regular basis ( every 3 mos. ) to make sure that they are happy with their subscriptions. And there are NO problems. Hint: Customers follow up is crucial to your business. If you do not follow up, your credibility can be destroyed. If you only call your customers once a year (when it is time to renew ), they will be less likely to renew through you if there have been problems and you were not available to handle them throughout the year.\n\nHere is a suggested contact schedule:\n\n1st Contact - Make the subscription sale. Let the customer know that you will be contacting them in approximately 3 months to verify arrival of "

6,"Good question and one for which there is really only a lot of conjecture. Based on the fossil record, there is some belief that some of the dromaeosaurs (Deinonychus, Utahraptor, Troodon, etc.) may have been capable of fairly complex vocalizations. Some of the best evidence, though, comes from fossils of Parasaurolophus. The ellaborate head crest contained a series of air passages that were believed to produce sound, not unlike a trombone. The CNN link below contains a nice article. Beyond vocalizations and the hooting and honking of dinosaurs like parasaurolophus, there is a school of thought that says that the sauropods (the long necked plant eaters) may have cracked their tails like a whip which could have been used for communication with the herd."

6,"When I was in your shoes, I signed up for Karate lessons.  I never had to actually fight, but the idea that I was studying fighting and was willing to fight for a hobby led the bullies to seek weaker victims.  The bullies themselves are essentially ego-challenged and won't risk being humiliated (although I wouldn't be so crude as to tell them this).  If you can, I recommend tradional Akido instead (not the crappy competitive junk ""American"" version).  If your dojo master is all about competition, move.  Real martial arts trains the body, mind, and soul, not just how to beat someone else up.\n\nIt's possible that your school is much worse than most (run more by gangs than the school staff).  If that's the case, moving would be a good career move because the quality of your school will be very low.  If that happens, then the REAL bullies (bosses, con artists, and the other adults that try to put you down) will haunt you for the rest of your life.  If you're in that situation and hellbent on staying, then good luck!  You will need to get a cultural change going and that will basically take getting the WHOLE school mobilized towards disempowering and ostracizing the gangs.  In this case, study either peaceful leaders like Gandhi and MLK if you want a pleasant school or violent leaders like the young Malcolm X or Ghengis Khan if you want the whole school carrying some sort of weapon.\n\nIn substantially less violent situations, calling on authorities like parents and teachers can be useful if done vindictively.  Don't let them think you're being a panzy about it, but present an attitude that the teacher/parent/other authority is actually seen as your tool of violence against them.  I also liked setting situations where they almost felt relieved to be caught - the ""aren't you glad that it's the teacher solving your problem and not me and my friends beating your head in"" routine works best after you've studied some martial arts.  At that point, you can emote pity for the bullies, who are really just stupid brutes and probably don't know any better.  This is a very different ""telling the teacher"" than when done in fear and cowardice because you are acting from a position of power.  Did I mention that they have fragile egos and hunt the weak and fearful?  They are slightly more evolved than dogs, although dogs are often better trained.  Being cruel doesn't really help and beating them up probably won't change them.  I was always willing to help them on their way to real rehabilitation services such that the teacher likewise understood that if they couldn't do the job and the principal couldn't do the job and their parents couldn't handle it, then the police were obliged to respond to calls - even if that led them to entering a classroom.  This also never had to happen, but my willingness to do whatever it took to get the kids not just punished but their heads ""fixed.""  Telling bullies directly that they have psychological problems is likewise not good advice, but the teacher should understand that counseling, juvenile detention, or having the bullies sent off to foster homes might also be the solution.  Again, for someone in your shoes, this isn't just a caring response, but also a ""and I'll be damned if I am going to put up with this kind of crap!"" attitude."

The difference is an evolutionary one, the man does the physical-labor like bringing the food home, the woman does the mental-labor like cooking, caring for the children, and just talking with their sweet voice, which is sweeter than those of men in general. The man needs stress-relief, and the physical attributes and verbal sounds of the woman are the ultimate stress-relief to the man."

The supply of crude oil, and crude oil inventories are ample. But the ability for the refineries to produce gasoline from the crude oil is at a maximum, and this time of year some of them shut down for maintenance (30-60 days), so gasoline supplies are even tighter.\n\nIn a free market, no matter the commodity, when Demand is greater than the Supply, the price goes up."

From a dialysis nurse, to psych nurse, to critical care nurse. The ONLY time a nurse is limited due to something less than a bachelor's is a managerial type of position. I suggest, because of the lack of nursing instructors, to get in the first available nursing school that accepts you. \n\nYou can actually get any position you desire. You'll see..just apply once you've passed your licensing exam and they will train you.\n\nRemember, when you are an RN, NO ONE cares if you are a two year RN or four year RN."

6,"I used to be a fireman. Most states have a Public Safety Training Center where any volunteer fireman can take classes. I would recommend: Basic Firefighter, CPR, First Responder, Pumper Operations, Hazmat / Chemical Fire Control and Vehicle Extraction. It is very time consuming. Fires always happen at the most in oppurtune times. Brush fires and forest fires are a pain in the ass and hard work. You will go to more accidents than fires. \nCar wrecks can be traumatizing. Being a fireman is not a hobby.\nTake the job and the responsibility seriously. It can cost you your life and quite possibly someone elses. It is a rewarding experience. I recommend it if you have the time."

6,"The CEO of a large company is one of the premier jobs in any country. Most of the CEOs of large companies come from backgrounds in accounting or finance, but some come from other areas such as marketing or engineering. Academic study in these areas and general business are the most helpful. Typically, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) is the terminal degree in business. A graduate from the best schools does have advantages. Who you meet at business school is as important as the quality of course work.\n\nAcademic credentials are one aspect of the upper-level corporate life, but do not guarantee success. Other necessary skills include, but are not limited to, people skills, a strong work ethic, communication and leadership skills. Because the stakes are high, politics will always have a predominate role. Pursuit of this office takes a lifetime of continuous improvement and dedication. Best wishes for your future success!"

Some do not have these fees and it may be a better idea for you.  Remember, the agent, once he agrees to represent you will take care of everything else, so choose wisely.\n\nTwo.\nYou must write at least a rough draft of your book.  Even a ghost writer (someone who writes books for other people) will require a rough draft of your story.  Get on that immediately.  I would recommend that you outline your story by bullet points.  \n\nJohn mets Nancy\nNancy's Mom dies\nJohn at the funeral\nNancy breaks up with John\nJohn cries at the bridge....\n\nOutlining helps non-writers and writers alike remember how they want to tell their story.\n\nGood luck and get to work."

Other stipulations may also be attached to the bond issue, such as the obligation for the issuer to provide certain information to the bond holder, or limitations on the behavior of the issuer. Bonds are generally issued for a fixed term (the maturity) longer than one year.\n\nA bond is just a loan, but in the form of a security, although terminology used is rather different.

I still needed to know a paycheck was coming every week with any business opportunity I took from home. \n\nI started working a home business opportunity while working outside the home while I was pregnant and now it brings in residual income..which means cash forever. \nI have pay checks that come in everyday and that will always continue.

True, I do have a B.A. Degree in Communication Studies/Radio, TV, And Film, but there are a number of people in broadcasting that have never set foot into a university classroom.  There are a lot of places that say they ""prefer"" applicants to at least have some college. On the other hand, some places will accept ""Real World"" experience in that particular field as enough to qualify you for employment.  Just remember, Very few people working today can actually say they love the job they currently have, or even expected to be working in the industry that they currently are.  Sometimes it comes down to what you need to do to survive.  But if you have a dream to do something, with your life, you have to at least give it a shot.  If you make it.... fantastic!  But if you dont make it, at least you tried, and will not have to live with ""What if I tried"" looming over you for the rest of your life."

Or just, we need this done.\n\nMany companies make the mistake of piling on work, but never setting realistic project end dates or ""rating"" the jobs their workers need to get done.\n\nWhen giving him a task, set due dates.  Tell him you must see a rough draft/outline in 1 week (or whatever).  When that is done, tell him that he must have ""x"" done by another date.  \n\nIt sounds to me like he needs some guidance to prioritize his days.  Maybe sitting down with him and expressing your concerns and asking him to write down all his daily/weekly/monthly responsibilites.  Then sit down with him and help him prioritize.\n\nI had a boss who was a ""great thinker"" at any one time I could be working on 20 different ""projects"" on top of my daily duties.  I quickly learned to keep a list of projects, and my regular duties handy, so that when he popped in asking about the info for some far-flung project I could pull out my list and ask him where my priorities should be.  It always worked to let him see just exactly what I was working on.\n\nNow, when I give my staff projects, I prioritize for them.  Telling them exactly what needs to be done first and when it needs to be done.   So, if they do not reach the due date, and have no good reason, I know I need to have a ""come to jesus"" talk with them about their future in my company.\n\nGood luck, he may just be a skirter."

S. waters within the 3-mile limit; however, the U. S. Government then passed title to the state in whose waters the shipwreck was located. If the shipwreck is outside of the territorial waters, then the general admiralty law applies. In order for someone to a finder, they must prove that the shipwreck has been abandoned by its original owners. If it has not been abandoned by its original owners, then the person recovering either the vessel or its contents would be treated as a salvor and would be entitled to a portion of the value retained."

6,"Bond duration is the easiest measure of interest rate sensitivity of a bond.  For instance, if a bond has a duration measure of 4, it means that for every 1 percentage change in the market interest rates, the bond value changes by 4%. \n\nThe duration measure is an approximation since it is trying to measure movement along the slope of a curve with a straight line equation. (If you know calculus, duration is the first derivative of the interest-price relationship).

6,"Proper Notice to Leave\nWhen a tenant wants to move out of a rental unit, it is important that the proper kind of notice be given to the landlord. The following discusses how to end the two most common types of rental agreements. However, it is important that tenants check their own rental agreements to determine what kind of notice must be given before they move out.\n\nLeases. If the tenant moves out at the expiration of a lease, in most cases it is not necessary to give the landlord a written notice. However, the lease should be consulted to be sure a formal notice is not required.\n\nIf a tenant stays beyond the expiration of the lease, and the landlord accepts the next month's rent, the tenant then is assumed to be renting under a month-to-month agreement.\n\nA tenant who leaves before a lease expires is responsible for paying the rent for the rest of the lease. However, the landlord must make an effort to re-rent the unit at a reasonable price. If this is not done, the tenant may not be liable for rent beyond a reasonable period of time.\n\nMonth-to-Month Rental Agreements. When a tenant wants to end a month-to-month rental agreement, written notice must be given to the landlord. The notice must be received at least 20 days before the end of the rental period (the day before rent is due). The day on which the notice is delivered does not count. A landlord cannot require a tenant to give more than 20 days notice when moving out.\n\nWhat if a tenant moves out without giving proper notice? The law says the tenant is liable for rent for the lesser of: 30 days from the day the next rent is due, or 30 days from the day the landlord learns the tenant has moved out. However, the landlord has a duty to try and find a new renter. If the dwelling is rented before the end of the 30 days, the former tenant must pay only until the new tenant begins paying rent.\n\nWhen a landlord wants a month-to-month renter to move out, a 20-day notice is required."

6,"LLC is a for profit entity while a not for profit is well, non profit \n\nFrom Wikipedia, ""a non-profit organization (often called ""non-profit org"" or simply ""non-profit"" or ""not-for-profit"") is an organization whose primary objective is something other than the generation of profit. Such organizations are typically funded through a mix of private or public (ie. government) donations""\n\nthe LLC is designed to give you the best of both worlds: the limited liability of a corporation while retaining a level of tax simplicity that resembles a partnership.\n\nFeatures of the LLC\n\n Limited Liability Status. The main attraction of an LLC is its limited liability status, a feature that it shares with corporations. The LLC limit your personal liability from business debts and damages incurred by the business. It basically lets you off the hook from legal liabilities such as court judgments and legal settlements obtained against the business.\n\n Tax Benefits. Like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations, the business profits and losses of an LLC are taxed at individuals' income tax rates. You will avoid a corporation's double taxation, where taxes are reported at a separate business level.\n\n Owners of the LLC. While owners of corporations are called stockholders, LLC owners are referred to as members. A member, who invests in the LLC and receive a percentage ownership interest in return, may be an individual or a separate legal entity such as a partnership or corporation. The percentage ownership is used to divide up the assets of the LLC when it is sold or liquidated, to split up profits and losses of the LLC or to divide up its voting rights. While an LLC can exist with one member, some states such as the District of Columbia and Massachusetts require LLCs to have two or more members.\n\n Flexible Management Structure. An LLC can be run either by its members or a management group elected by the members. While many small businesses are managed by their own members, an LLC can easily adopt a management-run structure in the following situations: the members decide to employ outside management help; not all of the members want to run the LLC; or an outside investor wants to be given a vote in management.\n\n Flexible Distribution of Profits and Losses. Similar to partnerships, dividing up profits among the LLC members is not restricted to the members' capital contributions. You may split up LLC profits and losses any way you wish, as long as it is provided for in the operating agreement."
6,"Yes, because that means i don't have to pay for everything.  For example if you have no money or car, i have to spend my gas money to drive my car (which i make payments on and pay for repairs) to your house to see you.  Or since you have no money you probably have no house and if you live in my house and can't pay rent, i end up paying for you.  If i want to go on a trip and you are broke, i have to pay for both of us.  If you have your own money i only have to pay for myself.  I can't do what i want to do with a poor guy unless i pay for him as well as me.  I want someone who will not get into my pocket and can pay for themselves to do all the fun things we do together whethre it is go roller skating or a cruise or eating out or even going to the grocery store.  THe gas & electric bill etc."
6,"Depreciation is a non-cash expense used to match asset utilization the the revenues those assets help generate.  The depreciation expense in and of itself does not contribute to cash, but the tax shield you get from having depreciation does create a source of funds.  For financial accounting, you have straight line, double declining balance, sum of years, etc...take the depreciation expense in any given year and multiply it by the tax rate in that year to get your depreciation tax shield (that is the amount of taxes you did not have to pay due to depreciation being there).  When you put your cash flow statement together, depreciation and all non-cash items are added back to net income in the Operating Cash Flow section.\n\nFor tax accounting, you have an accelerated method called MACRS.  Taking the depreciation percent from the MACRS table, multiplying the asset's book value by that percent yields your tax-based depreciation.  Multiplying this number by your tax rate will give you actual cash savings on your tax returns.  \n\nImportant to note that tax savings for financial statements and tax returns may be different.  Remember, the tax return data shows ACTUAL cash, so that will be the number you are most interested in.  The discrepency between financial statements and tax returns will be made up in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet."

6,"A great stock for beginners, and for 75 + % of all investors, is:VFINX. Okay, it's not really one single stock, but rather a collection of stocks; an Index Fund. This index fund buys all the stocks in the SP 500 according to their individual weightings. This is a great first investment because the investor gets exposure to all stocks in the SP 500 in one purchase. The other perk to owning index funds is that the fees associated with them are extremely low compared to mutual funds. This is because mutual fund managers select any stocks they want, as opposed to the strict rules of index funds, which, in the case, is concentrated in the SP 500. This sounds like a disadvantage; however, the numbers don't lie - mutual funds underpreform the SP 500 by 1-1.5 % over time. An index is a better choice than a single stock because your money does not ride on the prospects of one single company. In fact, this investment in VFINX will probably rise between 8-12 % annually for the next ten plus years. I recommend an index fund to most investors, not just beginners, because again, historically, index funds have returned a higher annual rate, AFTER EXPENSES, than mutual funds. In fact, VFINX has beaten 75 % of the other funds available, BEFORE EXPENSES, during the last 10 years. After expenses, VFINX has beaten over 90 % of all funds. Finally, you don't have to ""actively manage"" this purchase (aka look at the stock market everyday - although you could!) because, again, you own a small percentage of 500 of the best companies in the US. All this adds up to a relitively safe, solid long-term investment."

6,"First off, are you trying to land a job as a door attendant at a hotel, apartment, or bar (more of a bouncer-type job)?  If you're trying to become a doorman at a private residence, I'd say you are out of luck unless you are in a big city such as NYC.  I'm not very familiar with bouncer positions, as I try to avoid Food & Beverage workplaces.  \n\nI can help you out with a hotel position, as I have recently been hired as a doorman at a wonderful downtown hotel (I like to remain anonymous online, so I'll withhold the name).  Check out local hotels that are either very large or luxury properties (a downtown location would help).  Marriott's, Hilton's, Westin's, and Ritz-Carlton's would be a good place to start.  \n\nMost job applications are taken online but large hotel corporations, but I would advise going to the hotel or at least calling to find out about job availability and the application process.  If a job is available, make sure to attach a professional, carefully written resume to the application.  Learn about the company and craft the resume to their goals and expectations.  Always remember, whatever the company, to focus on service and customer interaction. The hospitality industry is obviously very concerned with these qualities, and they are even more important for a doorman position.\n\nBe prepared for the interview.  Again, research the company.  Ask pertinent questions that display effort into understanding the company as well as seriousness about accepting the position.  Look your best, as they will be looking for someone who is a good ambassador for their hotel.  Be professional, courteous, and always wear a smile.\n\nA doorman position may seem like an easy job to get; however, it is not the case.  Door attendants are the front line of the hotel and make a first impression on a guest.  This be an important factor in determining overall guest satisfaction.  In addition, most hotels that have door attendants are very upscale and are more difficult to be accepted into.  For example, I went through three interviews for my position, speaking with HR, my department head, and the director of operations (an individual who reports only to the General Manager).  Do not take the job lightly and always remember to act professional and hospitable.\n\nOn a final note, consider if you are the right person for the job before applying.  This one very important question will help to get you started:\n\nCan I be professional and act kindly AT ALL TIMES?\nThe job is based almost solely on guest interaction, therefore this is very important.  Guests may mistreat you, stiff you out of a tip, have outlandish requests, and may make you listen to their personal problems as well as their bad-mouthing of your organization.  If you can handle this and still wear a genuine smile, you will succeed.  If you cannot, you will either not get the job or be absolutely miserable.  An important note to add is that levels of professionalism vary by hotel brand.  For instance, the famous Ritz-Carlton brand focuses on rigid, scripted interaction with guests while the Westin, another luxury hotel, requires professional interactions yet encourages personal connections with guests and a more genuine personality.  Regardless of the brand, remember that you must truly have a servant's heart in order to take this job.  Keep this in mind when choosing a hotel to apply to."

6,"All important, and not important at all.\n\nI know that sounds confusing. Let me explain.\n\nPoor products and/or service can (but not necessarily) sink a food service operation. However, great products and service do not make an operation. By themselves, they are worthless. By having great products and service, you only meet the minimum expectations of your customer. Great products and service do not set you apart from your competition. They will not make you successful by themselves, but they can ruin you if you don't have them.\n\nThe most important factor to succeeding in the hospitality industry, as in any industry, is having a Unique Selling Point (USP). A USP is that ONE THING that sets you apart from your competition. People do not buy products and service. People buy emotions. People do not pay $150 an ounce for caviar because it's good. They pay that because it makes them feel important. The fact that it is good is a minimum expectation. They would expect it to be good if it cost $2 an ounce, or they would never buy it again.\n\nSome examples of marketing a USP overcoming quality of products or service include:\n\nHooters\n- product (sex)\n- weaknesses (low quality food, marginal service)\n- success (high)\n\nMcDonalds\n- product (convenience)\n- weaknesses (low quality food)\n- success (high)\n\nThere's a list a mile long of restaurants that overcome weaknesses through good marketing, choosing a USP and pushing it instead of their food. Even restaurants with good food and service that are successful have figured out that their quality is not the reason for their success, but merely a minimum expectation of their customer. They always have another product they are pushing, and it's always an emotion. \n\nEmotions sell. They are the real product.\n\nBrandon O'Dell\nO'Dell Consulting\nRestaurants/Retail/Bars\nhttp://www.bodellconsulting.com"

They can slap you with zoning violations and charge you with fines if you do not cooperate. Worse, they can close your business, or make it very hard for you to operate the business. Unless you have the resources to fight it out with the county, I suggest you start to make changes in your body shop and follow their recommendations to make your business compliant with the fire code. This may not be what you want to hear, but you have to realize that you may be in for greater liabilities in the event that a fire broke out from your shop -- even though you have already been warned that your shop is not fire code compliant. I hope your business has insurance."
6,"Michelle, some of the responses you're getting may depend on the age and maturity of you and your friends. Many people won't admit to these feelngs because they fear or do not understand them. Others may have been conditioned by their parents or friends to ignore or downplay these feelings. Often, the degree of openness on any given subject is directly related to the fear of embarassment or rejection."

6,"I am in the same situation with you, though the reasons are different. I work full time at a job because I love the work so much, while at the same time working with my husband on our business while raising 2 very young kids.\n\nAs you know, it is NOT EASY. Coupled with the fact that I am one big procrastinator, which did not help any.\n\nHere is what I do:\n\n1. The night before, I plan out a list of what I need to do both at work and for the business. If I don't I'm hopelessly lost and often fail to do what I need to accomplish that day.\n\n2. I have mastered the art of not sleeping (or sleeping very little). I work for the business when the kids are asleep - so that starts at around 9 pm. I'm often up until 1 or 2 am.\n\n3. I work around the kids' naptime. In 1-2 hours in the afternoons, I need to cram as many work as I could do because when they wake up, it will be very difficult to get the work done.\n\n4. Hire babysitters. They are the lifesavers and they keep me sane. And allows me the luxury of work.\n\n5. Take care of yourself. This is extremely important. Sometimes if you push yourself too hard, it is counterproductive. Take a rest sometimes, take a breater. One thing I realized is that work never ends - even if you do not sleep now, there will still be work waiting for you tomorrow."

If she's crying or making a scene yelling every time there's a problem that has to wear on people after a while."

6,"The nature of the evolving economy is to continuously remove those people or entities which don't add value through incessant competition - a race to the bottom.  Those ""middle-men"" need to examine their situation carefully and work out whether:\n\na) they add enough value to be safe from their customers AND their suppliers\nb) they could start to add enough value\nc) they could change their relationship with their suppliers in a way that safeguards their role\nd) they should get out while the getting's good\n\nMy parents owned an independent record store.  They added a lot of value to their customers through ordering, advice, calling them when something new came out which would interest them, etc.  But that only concerned a minority of loyal customers, and they saw the Internet coming and retired while they could.  The people who took over the shop found it folded within two years, partly through increased competition, but partly because they stopped adding that extra value which kept my parents afloat.\n\nIn my industry (IT), resellers are increasingly being squeezed and their role called into question.  My company is now starting to deal direct with customers, despite a long history working with channel partners.  It makes no sense for our sales reps to work for months at a multi-million-dollar corporate sale, and then ask a reseller to take a commission on that sale when we've done all the work.  However, we've traditionally relied on our resellers to perform the installation work as well.  And our delivery mechanisms are fine when the customer doesn't mind when their material arrives (e.g. PCs), but if it's a fleet of printers or servers which needs an installer to arrive at the same time, we get into the issue of staging.  Therefore there could still be a role for resellers to provide staging facilities local to customer sites, and then transport equipment to the final customer sites and perform the installation.  The material just wouldn't go through their books.  This is more in the line of (c) above, and there is money to be made by doing this.\n\nI hope these examples can spark thoughts of how, in your industry, you can find a way of adding value which might be slightly different from what you do today, but which can keep you in business."

It depends on what you want to do.  It can vary with species.  There is the general dog/cat vet.  But some work on pigs specifically.  Swine vets often work with producers with the environments, breeding, nutrition, and disease outbreaks.  They also do necropsies when there are deaths in the herd.  However, there is also the public health side to veterinary work.  And commercial (drug companies, nutrition companies), government, etc.  \n\nI cannot tell you what universities there are in Australia.  Contact a local veterinarian for information with that.

Miss too much work and you get fired and have to start all over again. \nThen you can get involved in a relationship, probably get married and have kids.

Highway 599 meets the Northern Ontario Resource Trail (formerly Highway 808) at Pickle Lake.\n\nThe Township of Pickle Lake has a population of 500 and its main industries are transportation (by air and land) and tourism. Pickle Lake's airport serves as the supply point to northern First Nations communities. It was formerly a mining site.

Your report is clear 7 years after the discharge.\n\nYou go to a consolidator and it takes 4 years to get clean. Then you need to wait an additional 7 years for your report to get clean.\n\nYou can get clean in about 8 years by filing or wait 12 years and pay a consolidator a boat load in fees for the first four years.\n\nIt's not a pleasant decision to have to make."

6,"Contact the Edward Jones investment rep nearest you.  Go to their website at www.edwardjones.com and enter your zip code to find the closest office.  With 10,000 locations, chances are there's one within 10 miles of where your live.\n\nAs for WHY your would want to this, contrary to the last answerer'a assertion that brokers don't find bonds sexy and hence don't bother learning about them, throughout their 135-year history, Edward Jones made their business on selling quality bonds to individual investors.  I've found some of the most knowledgable people I know regarding bonds to work for Edward Jones.  In addition, they do so much bond business that they get optimal pricing and that is in turn passed on to you.  When calling around for price quotes, at the very make sure you include them, you won't be sorry.\n\nI should point out that unless you need the money, now is probably not a good time to be selling your bond.  Although long-term interest rates (i.e., that of most bonds, which are driven by economic factors) have little to do with short-term rates (which are directly driven by the Fed), we are nevertheless in a rising interest rate environment and your bond undoubetdly is worth less than it wa a year ago.  Of course, you could be banking on that and need a tax loss for some reason, but barring that, if you're getting good interest, hold onto it until rates go down again to get a more advantageous price.\n\nOf course, when buying bonds specifaclly for the interest income, you should learn not to even care what the price is.  It's hard psychologically, and it takes some getting used to, but it's worth it.  After all, if you're buying a cow for the milk, then what the hell do you care about the price of beef?\n\nHope this help!\n--J."
6,"Because we are not all the greatest leaders, and even the greatest leaders need fools in all fields to get them from point A to B.\n\nI chuckle when people mention Bill Gates dropping out of Harvard to justify not finishing their education.  When he dropped out, Mr. G had a viable business and knew all he needed to know to make it work.  \n\nThe truth is this: people who want to learn will learn whatever the setting.  The schools are here to round out an education, and provide reassurance to employers that ""person A"" knows enough to function."
6,"Stock Market (or stock exchange) is a place where stock (or shares as we call in india) are traded between investors at a particular price that is purely determined by the demand and supply of the shares.\n\nFor example, if the demand of the share is greater than the supply, the price of the share will keep rising until the demand is equal to supply. As a result the price of the share goes up. Alternatively, if the supply of the share is more than the demand, the price of the share falls till it equals demand. \n\nNormally one would want to buy the shares of company that are performing good. This would result in a rise in demand of the shares and the price will start rising. The price will rise until the ivestors feel that the share price correctly co relates with the good performace of the company. Similarly one would try and sell shares of a company that is performing poorly and so the supply will rise. The price will continue to fall till investors feel that the price correctly corelates with the performance.\n\nIt is worth noting that any news that has an effect on the performance of the company will be reflected in the price movement of the share. For example, if the government announces that there is an upward revision in the price of petrol, the most likely gainers will be companies like Indian Oil, BPCL, HPCL, ONGC, Reliance etc. Therefore, their stocks (share prices) will start rising. Alternatively if the government announces that there is no revision in the price of petrol even though the price of crude is rising in the international market, the share prices of these companies will be under pressure and will probably fall. \n\nNow a days shares are held in dematerialized or demat (i.e. in electronic form without any paperwork involved) form with a share broker who is registered with the stock exchange. In India, there are two stock exchanges viz - \n\n1) The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)\n2) The National Stock Exchange (NSE)\n\nBoth the exchanges are headquarted in Mumbai. A broker can be a member of either of the two or both.\n\nSensex (Sensitive Index) is an index of the most commonly traded 30 stocks on the BSE. Time to time, the BSE allocates weightage to different stocks that reflect their importance in the stock markets. Take an example of two stocks RELAINCE and TATA POWER where both are included in the Sensex. If the stock price of Reliance goes up by Rs 10 and the stock price of TATA POWER falls by Rs 10, does it mean that they will balance each other? The answer is no. This is becuase the weight of the Reliance Stock is much more than Tata Power. In such a case the rise in the Reliance Stock will out weigh the loss in Tata Power's stock and the Sensex will rise (assuming other stocks remain where they are). It is to be noted that the sensex will either move upwards or downwards only the performace of these 30 stocks. Since the general mood of the market is reflected by the movement in the Sensex, it reamins in the news all the time.\n\nPlease note that this explanation is a very simple explanation on the movement in the Indian Stock Market. There may be many other factors that determine the demand and supply of shares.\n\nHope one finds this information useful."

I say more than one because talking with more agents will give you more ideas, see more health plan products, and – most importantly – get several different insurance agents competing two earn your business. Many people don’t realize it, but insurance plans aren’t any cheaper online than they are through an agent.\n\nWhen I’ve looked at small business matters, The National Associated for the Self-Employed (see link below) had some good information. They have a health care Web site with some good information as well (also below). Also, some states have group-purchasing pools for small business and the self-employed. Depending on the kind of business you’re in, there may be a trade association you can join and get group health insurance through them.\n\nAfter you’ve done some researching, try visiting MostChoice.com. I’m a writer for them, and they have a simple approach to shopping for health insurance. You fill out a short form, they send you information on health plans available in your state, and local state-licensed insurance agents contact you within 48 hours to talk about what you’re company needs in a group health plan. It’s free and you’re not required to buy anything from the agents who contact you. Just wait until one of them delivers an insurance solution that makes sense for you and your company.\n\nYou can visit MostChoice here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBarnes @ MostChoice."
6,"The market has changed in a lot of areas.   NO BUBBLE THOUGH.  the thing to remember is real estate is a local market.  That being said, these are the reasons a house usually sits on the market:  price, condition.  If it has been on the market since July, relatively that is NOT really a long time, everyone just forgot what a normal market was like in the frenzy of the past few years.  Now if everything else comparable is selling in a matter of weeks then again refer back to the two items above.  Some sellers are just testing the market, some really don't understand that the market determines the value of their home, not them, and some thought appreciation was going to skyrocket forvever instead of normalizing and so kept pulling equity out when they shouldn't have.  (that is a whole other story).  \n\nThere is not standard formula for determining when someone will drop their price.  Sellers are motivated by one of three things generally and which is their strongest determines their pricing strategy.  Time, money, or hassle.  Usually all sellers have all 3 motivations, but one is always the strongest.  If they are being transferred and have to sell in a limited time frame, then they will price slightly below market value, if they want (or need) as much money as possible and have all the time in the world, they may decide to price high (and end up chasing the market usually).  \n\nSo this house may be completely normal in days on market, it may be overrpriced, or it may be in bad shape, or the sellers could have all the time in the world to sell.  Your agent (not the seller's, get your own) should help you by determining market value, based on recent comparable sales, advise you as to market conditons and overall look out for your best interests and try to get you the best deal possible.  The listing agent's job is to do all that for the seller and they do not and cannot represent your best interests.  \n\nGenerally the seller pays the buyer's agent commission (the purpose of the MLS is to offer compensation) so it usually doesn't cost you anything to have your own agent.  I cannot stress this enough, GET YOUR OWN AGENT who will protect you and have a fiduciary duty to you!  And get one that knows what they are doing, that you are comfortable with and that you trust.  Their job is to advise you and help you through the entire process so you need to like working with them."

In contrast, a résumé is a summary typically limited to one or two pages highlighting only those experiences and credentials that the author considers most relevant to the desired position. CVs are the preferred recruiting tool for academic and medical professions while résumés are generally preferred for business employment.\n\n\nP.S.\nThe word résumé (often spelled resumé or resume) is used especially in the United States and in English Canada; the Latin term curriculum vitæ (often abbreviated CV) is instead used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, French Canada and some Commonwealth countries, as well as in the academic fields in North America, and in many languages other than English.

If they redirect your resume to HR, it's a lot better than you just sending it there.  If you mail a hard copy, give them some examples of how you've done ""next level"" work before. The worst they can do is throw it out."
6,of course you will! people won't discriminate against you because you look young... I was in the same sitation when i was your age. I am now 21 and have always looked young.  (It's a good thing when you get older!!) I found that because i had a professional attitude and was mature in the way i acted and spoke to people i was fine.  You need to think positively and try your best... you can only do that.\nGood luck!

6,"By definition a driveway is really a private road that connects to the public street system.  Today, these 'roads' are usually short, but the name sticks.  We park our cars on them because, after having 'driven' the 'way' to the private house, we would obviously have to stop when we arrived.  We drive on parkways because the 'park' of parkway is not the same word as 'park' meaning to stop.  A parkway is defined as broad road usually marked with scenery and a landscaped island.  Scenery? Landscaping?  Sounds a lot like a 'park', as in the recreation space.  Thus we drive on parkways because they are glorified ('park' like) road (Latin 'via' = road, and 'via' is also related to the word 'way', hense a 'parkway' literally a 'park-like road').  Hope this helps."

6,"There is so much to do.  We just went through it for the 3rd time.  buying a house isn't a fun thing.  it is stressful but rewarding in the long run if you do your homework.  \n\nYou don't need to have a realestate agent.  We bought all three homes without using our own personal agent and we also sold both of our homes without any agent.  What you DO need to have, is a good lawyer to handle all the paperwork and contracts.  ( ours cost about $800) small investment but very worth it!!\n\nI would start looking for a home AT LEAST 3 to 4 months in advance of when you actually want to be moved in.  The hunting part can take 2 to 3 months even longer if your picky/ or there isn't much to choose from.  Then comes the closing process.  This is the time you get the mortgage loan, the title, the home inspection, and all other legal stuff out of the way.  Finally you will be ready to close on the home.  This is the day that was set by the bank, you and the seller for the ownership to change hands.  \n\nYou will need to have enough money in your bank to cover the down payment you will be putting - along with closing costs.  the average closing costs are about $5,000 to $8,000.  So you need to be ready for that.  \n\nI would suggest not to get in too deep. don't go for interest only loans, they are a bad idea.  If you can't afford a house with a regular fixed rate mortgage you should probably hold off until you are finacially ready.  \n\nThere is just so much more than what I posted above.  If you are serious about buying a home - you should start researching it many months in advance so that you will not be in over your head and get taken advantage of. \n\nGood luck"
6,"Yes money really can be made by selling on e-bay. As with any endeavor, it is wise to research prior to jumping in. Make sure that the product you are selling is doing well on the site.

Then once you feel comfortable, go for it. I did, don`t regret it one bit. You`ll also find that many of the people you deal with there are very helpfull."

But of course, people will recognize/remember your logo because of the celebrity."

If a large influx of military personnel overloads the local housing supply, property values are likely to increase, possibly significantly.\n\nI'd be concerned, but I'd also keep a very close watch on general property values as well as what's going on with the military.

These principles include an unhindered free enterprise system, a free market, and political democracy. These beliefs have led him to suggest that the form of government most conducive to freedom is one with impartial laws which guarantee social order and the unregulated expression of human life. \n\nHayek is a major figure in contemporary economic thought and is generally credited with inspiring England's shift away from a government-controlled economy. But because his ideas ran counter to the prevailing collectivist views of other economists for several decades, Hayek's ""fame and his influence have been achieved very much against the flow of fashionable opinion,"" Michael Ivens writes in the Spectator. \n\nHayek has written on such diverse subjects as monetary theory, inflation, socialism, political freedom, unemployment, and scientific methodology, but he is most highly regarded for his books examining the relationship between economic systems and personal freedom."

A debt settlement is usually reached when a debtor is unable to fully meet his/her debt obligations due to financial hardships and attempts by the creditor to collect on the debt have failed. The creditor agrees to cancel part of the debt and accept the remaining sum as full repayment. Debt settlement is also called debt negotiation. Technically speaking, a debt settlement is the agreement while debt negotiation is the process through which both parties reach that agreement.\n\n\nDebt relief is the partial or total forgiveness of debt, or the slowing or stopping of debt growth, owed by individuals, corporations, or nations. It concerns in particular the Third World debt, which started exploding with the Latin American debt crisis (Mexico 1982, etc.)."

6,"I used to be a cutter.  I would do it becuase I would have so much emotional pain, cutting myself would hurt physically so it would take my mind of my emotional problems, instead I could focus on the physical pain.  \n\nI stopped becuase I went to a psychiatrist and got medication for depression.  That helped A LOT!!!\n\nAs far as what to say to your friend... my friends never knew what to say to me (my best friend talks about it with me a lot now that I don't do it anymore).  I actually scared them a lot.  Maybe just let your friend know that it scares you when they hurt themselves.  Then try to get them to go get help for it.  You can talk about the underlying issues, but if they are at the point of cutting then unfortunately they most likely need professional help.  That is a sign of a psychological disorder.\n\nAt work I have seen several kids that do this.  They give reasons for doing it anywhere from my reason to wanting to see what it would do, to wanting to kill themselves and just ""hoping i would cut deep enough"".  \n\nSo like i said, talk to your friend.  Try to find the underlying issue, and get them help.  Be there for them.  Good luck."

6,"Support your son.  Let him know that you'll be proud, no matter his occupation.\nAs far as the bad attitude, listen to what he's saying.  Try to listen without judgement, without forming your responses while he talks.  Paraphrase back to him his thoughts/concerns, to make sure you understand.  Once he feels understood, he will be more likely to listen to you.  He may not agree with all you are saying, just as you may  not agree with him, but you'll be communicating!  That can't be wrong."

6,"No. It's gone. Whoever bought it owns it and is under no requirement to sell it back to you. The time to do something about this was before the foreclosure sale, preferably before things reached this point. Not only that, if the lender did not recoup the money owed in the foreclosure sale, they can still come after you to collect the rest of what they are owed. And your credit rating will reflect this disaster for many years to come. Sorry.\n\nPS If this had been a tax sale (your property was sold to pay off unpaid real estate taxes) you would have had a period afterwards in which you could still buy back your property. But a foreclosure sale is permanent."

Simple; some are incapable of seeing how good a thing they had until it is gone & immature enough to think that a little ""I love you"" will make everything better. They don't understand that, if a man really loves a woman, he doesn't intentionally hurt her...whether physically or emotionally.\n\nGood luck & keep trying! You'll find a good guy.

6,"Usually there's no minimum, but some companies do charge you a fee if you're inactive.\n\nJust so you know, there are a lot of good brokererages depending on what you like and how you trade.\n\nBarron's Online has a great article on brokerages that they publish each year. (I'll try to find you the link for the March 6,2006 article)\n\nFor basic stuff, E*Trade, Ameritrade, and Scottrade are sufficient. For more complex trades, I'd recommend Optionsxpress, ThinkorSwim, or interactivebrokers. \n\nBased on what you put in your question, I'd recommend one of the first three, or maybe Optionxpress, but all are very good. Cheapest probably is scottrade (of the larger online firms). Yes there are cheaper like interactivebrokers, but you'll have to get used to their software based platform (which is doable). They're only about $1/contract on options!\n\nBrokerages like Fidelity are horrible for anyone with any decent experience. \n\nSo, decide what's important to you as a trader and compare the brokers! You can use the article, or go to each website as they all seem to have comparison charts! \n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.\n\nHope that helps!"

Charting, trends, RSI, stochastics, CCI, moving averages, etc.\n\nOr do you mean for Fundamental Analysis? P/E ratios, cash flows, balance sheets, stock recommendations, etc.\n\nWhen you say ""best"" do you mean most advanced, fastest, most indicators, most widely used, most expensive, best for advanced users or best for beginners? \n\nYou have to tell us where you are coming from and what you are trying to do before we can be specific.\n\nThe Cadilac of Technical Analysis software is called TradeStation, but it is very expensive with loads of features and I believe it even has a back-testing system for writing your own program indicators. You would not buy this system for an occasional trade, but would be a full-time trader or fund manager to warrent this system. Otherwise, it is overkill.\n\nThe most technologically advanced Technical Analysis software is RealTick, at TerraNovaOnline.com\n\nTerraNova is an online broker with low rates, owned by Townsend Electronics. Townsend is the company that recently digitized and electronified the NASDAQ. I believe they are in the process of doing the American Stock Exchange now. These people are ""the"" technology innovators.\n\nAlso with TerraNova, you can trade anything and everything, including stocks, futures, options, commodities, forex, all of it. I'm not aware of another broker whom can do this.\n\nTo trade everything, Realtick leases for $275/mo, but one segment is $175/mo. \n\nFor beginners, or occasional traders, they have the Investor platform, which is RealTick sized down to one screen. I believe this platform is free, or very little, so very well may be your ""best"" bet"

7,According to the Justice League TV show.  Aquaman can breath both water and air.

He is super strong so forcing water in and out of his lungs would not be that big of an issue.  I know that he use to only be able to stay out of the water for an hour or two because of 'drying out' and loosing consciousness.

They really also need to answer some of the big questions about the island before they start posing more...like the whispering voices in the jungle, the smoke monster thing, the polar bear, the giant foot statue, the shark with the logo on it's tail, and the ship in the middle of the jungle to name a few."

7,I've been playing bass for ten years now and got my degree in music with the bass as my major instrument.  I personally have never been that excited by Fender basses.  To me they have no character in their tone and they just seem very generic.  BUT alot of other people fell every different. MY advice is to spend some time in a number of music shops (if possible) and play every bass they have.  I would even take in your amp and other equipment because that can have an effect on the sound as well(again if it's possible) once you find the bass that has the right sound feel and of course price then you have found your bass and don't care what company made it.

The more clamorous and outgoing of the two, Soo-kyoung, asks Ji-hae to do her a favor - write a love letter to Sang-min. Ji-hae pours out her own feelings for him on paper, but sadly in her friend's name. Touched by the letter, Sang-min is attracted to Soo-kyoung, and Ji-hae, feeling uncomfortable and even guilty, tries to avoid him. And yet by coincidence or by fate she keeps running into him.\n\nJi-hae has lived alone with her mom since her childhood, when her dad unexpectedly passed away. Her mom is now on a trip abroad, and to wile away her solitude she starts cleaning the attic. There Ji-hae finds a secret box, in which her mom kept the memorabilia of her first love story of some decades past.\n\n\nthe rest of the summary can be found here: http://hancinema.net/korean_movie_The_Classic.php"

7,"Are you talking about electronic DJs? They don't have a club or anything. Besides the DJs aren't the ones to talk to to get a gig spinning in a club. You need to find out who owns the club and find out who throws the parties. Whoever the producer is will listen to you to see if you have any talent to put you on. Who cares what other DJs think of your music. Chances are if they like it they will steal it and if they don't like it then it is because they just have different taste. There will be someone out there who enjoys what you have to play though. If you want to sing in these clubs then you do need to find a DJ to work with, Just go to some clubs that are playing the music that suites you and when you hear someone you like just give him or their roadies your stuff. Good luck"

7,"In the original Hellraiser movies, as far as I know, he's only listed as ""Lead Cenobite"", but as the story evolves over several movies, we are given some more details of his name and pre-Cenobite life. Apparently, he went by the name of Captain Elliot Spenser, an explorer and British Army veteran from World War 1 - check out the link below for more details, courtesy of Wikipedia.\n\nAs a journalist, it would be interesting to meet Doug Bradley, but as you mention the fee being in dollars, and I'm based in London, it looks unlikely that I'd be able to come shake the man' hand for showing the world a fantastic, multi-layered very human monster."
7,"At first people believed that he was not dead, that he was just in hiding. And that whole Makaveli thing made people believe that he would do as the original Makaveli did, which was to return in 7 years to take revenge against his enemies or what have you, but as we can all see the seventh year has come and gone so I believe that his time here on earth has really come to an end. All of the conspiracies that have been out regarding his death, fake autopsy pictures, garbled words at the beginning of songs, I believe just help to add that extra nudge for people to buy into him. I think he is dead but boy wouldn't it be great if he did come back after all these years. And as far as his albums are concerned I believe that many rappers have unreleased music that we have never and probably will never get to hear. Tupac probably had hundreds of raps that he had written and recorded in the studio long time ago, all they have to do is get a genius of a producer and lay Tupac's words down onto a really good track and it would sound like he just recorded it yesterday."

7,"Well, I definitely don't think it's uncommon for guys to choose the ""wrong"" girl. Guys tend to think about the wrong thing when it comes to virginity, which is what they're doing instead of who they're doing it with. To me, it doesn't matter how old you are when you lose it, because it's not a contest. It's all about feeling comfortable with the person you're with and wanting it to be with them. I say to hell with today's standards because there are kids in elementary school these days having sex and getting pregnant - it's ridiculous! But somehow our society would rather have that than being embarrassed by a plethora of 25 year-old virgins.\n\nI never was phased by my peers when it came to my choices. I lost mine at a fairly ""normal"" age, which was 15, and it also needs to be kept in mind that I am much more mature in my thinking than others that age because of how I grew up with a bunch of brothers who were pretty promiscuous. I knew I wasn't going to do it unless I REALLY felt it was right, and that's exactly what happened. I am glad that I did it, because it helped me learn even more (but in a good way since it was my own content choice). And, I haven't had any other partners since him.\n\nI say, don't have any shame if you lost it at 20 - I actually praise you for that because most guys would have broke down just to be a part of the crowd well before that. But if you wish it was with another girl, just take it as future advice for yourself. You can't change what happened before but you know how to feel about it now, so I think that's what's important. I'd rather be like that than someone who does it with 10 wrong girls."

My wife and I have watched them all and are furious because there are none left.  Another idea, start with the first season of 24 and continue until you finished the fourth.  There is not a show out there that will force you to run to the rental store at midnight in your pj's hoping they havnt locked the doors yet except for 24.  You will love it.

Everywhere there.. Amazing.."

7,"Heritage USA is the 2,300 acre Christian theme park/water park/residential complex built in Fort Mill, South Carolina, by ""PTL Club"" founders televangelist Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye Bakker.\n\nHeritage USA opened in 1978, and by 1986 was one of the top vacation destinations in the nation, right behind Walt Disney World and Disneyland, attracting nearly 6 million visitors annually and employing more than 2,000 people. However, after Jim Bakker's legal and personal troubles made headlines starting in 1987, Heritage USA closed.\n\nThe Heritage USA property was bought by a Malaysian investment group (Malayan United Industries Berhad — MUI Corporation) and is now known as Regent Park. MUI is also the parent company of Laura Ashley USA which moved its headquarters and distribution center to the property. MUI, through its local subsidiary, Regent Carolina Corporation built a large golf course and residential development on the majority of the former Heritage USA property.\n\nIn December 2004, the remainder of the Heritage USA property was sold to Coulston Enterprises, a local developer. Coulston Enterprises sold portions of the property formerly housing the PTL Ministry to MorningStar Ministries of Charlotte, North Carolina and Flames-of-Fire Ministries of Fort Mill, South Carolina. They are now in process of renovating the property and buildings back to their original condition. Coulston Enterprises has planned a mixed-use development featuring single family homes, town homes, shops and ministry-related functions on the remainder of the property. The former Heritage Grand Hotel will be used as a retreat and conference center as well as a church for MorningStar's local congregation. The hotel complex has been renamed ""H.I.M."" for Heritage International Ministries. The unfinished Heritage Grand Tower will be completed and used as a hospice and assisted living facility/retirement home. The property encompassing the former PTL Television Studios, The Upper Room, The Amphitheater, Barn Auditorium, Campgrounds and Bunkhouses has been renamed Crown International by Flames-of-Fire Ministry."

A high-profile couple like the two of them just has wider appeal because they're celebrities and more people know about them."

Oh yeah, I agree...GAY NAME, and GAY ATTITUDE. I can say, tell your friend Tammy to break with him too so that he'll learn something valuable about relationships. You know, Its true that guys are...""impressed"" and ""attracted"" to beautiful bodies...maybe such as yours. Well, you know, if you already know that whom your going out with doesnt really want love, better split with him girl, he wants your body. He wants SEX. And I dont think you like getting laid down or worse, getting raped, now would you? So...all I can say is, split with him, then take revenge at him. Here's one I thought about: Call all his other 3 girlfriends, tell them what this rikky boy has been doing to all of you, and just wait for the results. You should have a conference between the 4 of you girls about that playboy so that each and every one of you would have an evidence that he's been playing on you guys. Good luck girl! ^_^"

According to his catalogue, No. 626 from your example would be the Requiem in D minor that Mozart composed in 1791 shortly before his death.\n\nOf course, the exact dates of many of his works is a wild guess at best and there's has been a lot of re-dating, re-evalution and re-arrangement since the first edition in 1862. The last major changes and corrections were included in 1964 (6th edition)."

7,"Good point!  I think that is exactly what he'll do. It seems whenever the limelight moves away from him, he comes up with something else so that everyone swarms around him again.  First it was Penelope Cruz, then Katie Holmes, then they were engaged, then they were having a baby, then people got used to that, then he announces he's buying an ultrasound monitor for his home.  He loves and needs publicity."

7,"It's kind of long, but I like this one, from near the end of ""When Harry Met Sally"" (admittedly, a bit of a knock-off of ""Annie Hall"").  I think it expresses the idea of knowing somebody thoroughly, and loving them despite their quirks:\n\n""I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."""

7,"Apocalypse. This fight won't even take more than 5 minutes if Apocalypse wanted. First of all I have to say that Wolverine is one of the best mutants out there. Plus he has his healing factor, which helps him all the time when he fights. However, the power that Apocalypse has it's unmeasurable. He in not only the oldest and baddest mutant alive but he is immortal as well. He can change shape, size, he can teleport, live without food, air, water, he can blast, oh man, what can't Apocalypse do. So all those said, even if some people might argue that if Apocalypse blasts off Wolverine, he might heal, then all Apocalypse has to do is to teleport Wolverine on a planet without air, or a deserted one. If not, he could just make Wolverine give all that he has until he passes out of tierdness. \n\nWinner: Apocalypse"

7,"It's completely possible. There are some people who are born with an aptitude for it, but those people are few and far between.  Most professional musicians aren't ""born with it"" per se, but work very hard and become better at what they do.  These people will never be looked upon as the greatest musicians of our time, but a living they will make.  Some people (Mozart, Beathoven, Lennon, Clapton, etc.) have undeniable God given abilities, but if you committ yourself to it, anything is possible."

7,"Older men like younger women to make themselves feel young as others have said. But if the girl is a lot younger it makes the man seem even older and other people will think he is the girl's father. They might think the girl is only after the guy's money. Let's face it, just as a man doesn't want a woman who looks old, a young woman won't want some old guy's wrinkled old a-ss either. An age difference of 10 years is still ok but anything more than that starts to become inappropriate. And let's not overlook older women. I've seen some very hot older women out there."

7,"Marketing, marketing, marketing. Movie producers make stories from books as appealing to a general audience as possible. Hence, characters are changed, plots are redone, and the entire story takes on a whole new life. Books are often inner-reflective, meaning that we get inside a character's head and their inner thoughts much more. You can't do that in film unless you have the character constantly narrating which would be very annoying. Movies take a more precise story due to time and in doing so lots of things are cut out and things adapted to adhere better to actors and directors who may be attached to the project."

That said, there were still some entertaining parts, not the least of which being Doom's contstant comedic foil, Klaw.

7,"Speculation abounds as to the nature of the mysterious glowing contents of the case:\nCould it be Elvis's gold suit, seen worn by Val Kilmer (as Elvis) in True Romance (1993)?\nThe most persistent theory (most usually attributed to a friend of a friend who saw it posted on a message board by someone whose brother had read a report of a radio interview with Tarantino himself) is that it is Marcellus Wallace's soul. The story goes that when the Devil takes a person's soul, it is removed through the back of the head (this isn't part of any known religion, but this is what the message board posters say). When we see the back of Marcellus's head he has a Band-Aid covering the precise spot indicated by tradition for soul removal. Perhaps Marcellus sold his soul to the devil which would also explain why the combination to open the briefcase is 666.\nQuentin Tarantino has said that the band-aid on the back of Marsellus Wallace's neck had nothing to do with an allusion to the Devil stealing Marsellus's soul... but that the actor Ving Rhames had a scar on the back of his neck he wanted to cover up.\nOr could it be simply a 20-watt light bulb?\nAccording to Roger Avary, who co-wrote the script with Quentin Tarantino, the original plan was to have the briefcase contain diamonds. This seemed neither exciting nor original, so Avary and Tarantino decided to have the briefcase's contents never appear on screen; this way each filmgoer could mentally ""fill in the blank"" with whatever struck his or her imagination as best fitting the description ""so beautiful"". The orange light bulb (projecting shimmering light onto the actors' faces) was a last-minute decision and added a completely unintended fantastic element.\nIn a radio interview with Howard Stern in late 2003, Quentin Tarantino was asked by a caller the contents of the briefcase, and he answered, ""It's whatever the viewer wants it to be."""

7,"The aftermath of Nate’s departure\nNow that the former Raro tribe members know that Jonathan has betrayed them, they are mad as hell.  Pavarti openly discusses her disappointment and betrayal with Jonathan himself.\n\nGoing once, twice…\nIt’s time for the Survivor food auction, and the Survivors are each given $500 to use to purchase food.  They can not share their food, but they can give each other money.  Some of the dishes were covered so the Survivors would have to bet without knowing what was on the tray.  Others were visable.\n\nJonathan pigs out…\nJonathan wins a mystery platter which turns out to be a hot dog, French fries, and beer.  He accidentally spills some of his beer.  Pavarti spends nearly all of her money on a slice of decadent chocolate cake and a bubble bath.  Yul loans Becky money so that she can spend $620 on something that would “give you power in the game”. \n\nFourth time around\nBecky’s power comes in the form of being allowed to send someone to Exile Island.  When she picks Candice for the fourth time, I almost felt sorry for Candice… almost, but not quite!\n\nFood and confessions\nYul admits to everyone that he has the immunity idol and even shows it to them.  Ozzy spends $420 on some ice cream (a lot of it).  Jonathan ends up with a pepperoni pizza and some mouthwash.  Everyone else leaves hungry because the auction is over.  \n\nObnoxious Jonathan\nBack at camp, Jonathan continues to grate on people’s nerves by being totally obnoxious.  His agitating behavior prompts Yul and the former Aitu members to chance the order of who will be voted off when.  After all, they could vote off Jonathan and still retain a larger number than the former Raro tribe.  Should the vote Jonathan out before Candice?\n\nOff on Exile Island\nCandice cries and whines on Exile Island.  She tells us how much she misses Adam.  I can’t help but remembering how she betrayed her tribe, and I’m sorry, but I couldn’t muster a shred of sympathy for her.\n\nImmunity- up for grabs!\nAt this point in the game, the Survivors realize how valuable the immunity idol is.  They compete in a challenge that is a combination of trivia and math.  For once, the former Aitu tribe members were not in their element.  Three people moved on to the final round of this competition.  Pavarti, Jonathan, and Nate were left standing.\n\nAnd the winner is…\nAs the remaining three Survivors raced through an obstacle course to untie ropes and raise a flag, Adam pushed way ahead.  When he finished the challenge first, he casually and cockily raised his flag before Jeff put the immunity necklace around his neck.\n\nThe plot…\nThe tribe members continue to try to convince the others, especially Yul, to vote off Jonathan next. Yul confesses to Jenny that he thinks maybe he should do it because it would help him gain favor with people when they are on the jury later – he would have a better chance of getting their vote than if they kept Jonathan around.\n\nWhat’s for dinner?\nAs Pavarti, Candice, and Adam cuddle in the tent, Jonathan brings home dinner.  The former Aitu tribe members feast on fish.  Candice wakes up, notices the other tribe members eating, and stalks angrily over. \n “Since when do you guys not share food?”  She accused.  This began the battle between Jonathan and Candice.   \nCandice also went on to say, “All these people said they don’t like you!” about the Aitu members.  The argument was a heated one.\n\nGoodbye kiss\nAt tribal counsel, the vote is anybody’s guess.  Will it be Jonathan or Candice?  Adam wears his immunity necklace, safe from the vote as the decision is made for Candice to leave the island.  She and Adam start kissing goodbye, and the moment is more nauseating than sweet.  \n\nJeff’s wise words\nJeff said it all in his closing words, “A kiss was nice.  Maybe if it was love, he’d have given you the immunity necklace.”"

7,"Amanda Lear (born November 18, 1946 in Hong Kong, of a French/English father and Asian/Russian mother) is a singer and was a disco queen in the 1970s. She was engaged to the lead singer of Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry. She was also the model on the cover of the Roxy Music album For Your Pleasure.\n\nDuring the 1960s painter Salvador Dalí was her companion, and although she was Dali's protege she also became David Bowie's lover. In 1979, she married the aristocrat Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Villele, French writer Roger Peyrefitte's lover and adoptive son.

This story follows her to this day, although it was also rumoured to be a publicity stunt thought up by her, Bowie and Salvador Dalí.\n\nIn 1977, Amanda signed a recording contract, thanks to her success as a model. Her debut single was a cover of Elvis Presley's ""Trouble"" it was not featured on the first album and has not been released on CD to date. Her first album was entitled I Am A Photograph and was a tongue in cheek reference to her days as a model with the Zoli Model Agency. It produced hit singles such as ""Blood And Honey"", ""Alphabet"", ""Tomorrow"", ""La Bagarre"" (The Fight), ""These Boots Were Made For Walking"" (a cover of the Nancy Sinatra classic) and one of her more well-known and bigger hits is the song ""The Queen of Chinatown"" released as a non-album single."

7,"I've lived in a KCMO suburb my whole life.  It is great.  The people are very friendly and it is a great place to raise a family (suburbs are better than the city itself).  Kansas City doesn't have good public schooling, but there are many suburbian schools that are wonderful.  Blue Springs and Lee's Summit to name a few.  \n\nThere is plenty to do in KC and the surrounding area.  There is a pretty cool Jazz district and efforts are underway to revitalize our downtown area.  The Plaza is an upscale shopping area that has our trademark fountains.  Even though it is pricey, it is a great place just to hang out and take a walk.  Crown Center is another fun place...especially at Christmastime.  There are lakes in the surrounding areas, plenty of good restaurants (we're known for our barbecue), and interesting historical places (Harry Truman's library and home, the Negro Leagues Museum just to name a few).  We have Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun...not as popular as Six Flags but it's something.\n\nThe weather is up and down...we truly have four seasons.  Summers can heat up to upper 90s with lots of humidity, and our winters can bring lots of snow.  Fall is beautiful...lots of color.  \n\nKansas City is a great place to be.  I have loved it all my life and don't ever want to leave!"

7,"Hi . . the show you're referring to was ""3 Girls 3"" . . . it was a summer replacement show in 1977 and was not on the schedule as a fall listing.  Mimi Kennedy was, indeed, in the show, as were Carol Burnett and Jack Albertson (among others).  However, Bess Armstrong was not among the cast members.  I do believe the blonde singer you're referring to is Ellen Foley (b. 1951).  Go to Yahoo search and put in her name and there are several articles on her.  You can also her up under Yahoo images . . . unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything current on her.  I hope this helps."

7,"Melinda found out that the man with the hat did not want the other ghosts to cross over.  He was doing everything in his power to make the ghosts stay on earth (which Melinda didn't like).  The man with the hat told Melinda that he would set free the ghosts who died from the crash in exchange for her life (because she was ""the one"").  But Melinda continued to do her work and convinced majority of the ghosts to follow the light and cross over.  Some, however, chose to follow the man with the hat and so these ghosts remained on earth.\n\nAndrea's brother, fortunately, did not take the flight and was spared from the crash.  However, Andrea herself was among those who died when the plane crashed over the town.  Andrea's car got hit by the plane when it was going down.  When Melinda finally told Andrea about this, Andrea was in tears and could not seem to accept it.  Then, the man with the hat was suddenly walking behind Andrea -- as if making an attempt to steal her away from Melinda, so that Andrea would not cross over.  That was the end of the episode."

They were simply the best before they left.\n\nAnd I agree, they shouldn't have come back. They ruined it. Their newest CD wasn't that great. But the old Backstreet Boys, those I was in love with.\n\nAnd when I went to a concert Wango Tango 2005 in Anaheim, California, they performed and I went crazy!!! It just brought back memories. They sang Incomplete, I want it that way, and Backstreet's Back, and some other song I can't remember, but it was the best experience."

7,"Now when I was a young man I carried me pack\nAnd I lived the free life of the rover.\nFrom the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback,\nWell, I waltzed my Matilda all over.\nThen in 1915, my country said, ""Son,\nIt's time you stop ramblin', there's work to be done.""\nSo they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun,\nAnd they marched me away to the war. \n\nAnd the band played ""Waltzing Matilda,""\nAs the ship pulled away from the quay,\nAnd amidst all the cheers, the flag waving, and tears,\nWe sailed off for Gallipoli.\nAnd how well I remember that terrible day,\nHow our blood stained the sand and the water;\nAnd of how in that hell that they call Suvla Bay\nWe were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.\nJohnny Turk, he was waitin', he primed himself well;\nHe showered us with bullets, and he rained us with shell --\nAnd in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell,\nNearly blew us right back to Australia. \nBut the band played ""Waltzing Matilda,""\nWhen we stopped to bury our slain,\nWell, we buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs,\nThen we started all over again.\nAnd those that were left, well, we tried to survive\nIn that mad world of blood, death and fire.\nAnd for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive\nThough around me the corpses piled higher.\nThen a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head,\nAnd when I woke up in me hospital bed\nAnd saw what it had done, well, I wished I was dead --\nNever knew there was worse things than dying. \nFor I'll go no more ""Waltzing Matilda,""\nAll around the green bush far and free --\nTo hump tents and pegs, a man needs both legs,\nNo more ""Waltzing Matilda"" for me.\nSo they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed,\nAnd they shipped us back home to Australia.\nThe armless, the legless, the blind, the insane,\nThose proud wounded heroes of Suvla.\nAnd as our ship sailed into Circular Quay,\nI looked at the place where me legs used to be,\nAnd thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me,\nTo grieve, to mourn and to pity. \nBut the band played ""Waltzing Matilda,""\nAs they carried us down the gangway,\nBut nobody cheered, they just stood and stared,\nThen they turned all their faces away.\nAnd so now every April, I sit on my porch\nAnd I watch the parade pass before me.\nAnd I see my old comrades, how proudly they march,\nReviving old dreams of past glory,\nAnd the old men march slowly, all bones stiff and sore,\nThey're tired old heroes from a forgotten war\nAnd the young people ask ""What are they marching for?""\nAnd I ask meself the same question. \nBut the band plays ""Waltzing Matilda,""\nAnd the old men still answer the call,\nBut as year follows year, more old men disappear\nSomeday, no one will march there at all.\nWaltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda.\nWho'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?\nAnd their ghosts may be heard as they march by the billabong,\nWho'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

7,"All brothers and their real names were\n\nManfred was born in 1885 and died in infancy \nChico - Leonard, 1887-1961 \nHarpo - Adolph (later Arthur), 1888-1964 \nGroucho - Julius Henry, 1890-1977 \nGummo - Milton, 1892-1977 \nZeppo - Herbert, 1901-1979 \n\nBorn to a family of artists, the musical talent of the brothers was encouraged from an early age. Harpo was especially talented, and could play nearly any instrument; however, his focus was the harp, from which he derived his nickname, and which he often played on film. Chico was an excellent and histrionic pianist, and Groucho played the guitar.\n\nThey got their start in vaudeville, where their uncle Albert Schönberg was performing as Al Shean of Gallagher and Shean. Groucho's debut was in 1905, predominately as a singer. By 1907 he and Gummo were singing together as two-thirds of The Three Nightingales with Mabel O'Donnell. The next year, Harpo became the fourth Nightingale. By 1910, the group was expanded to include their mother and their Aunt Hannah, and the troupe was renamed The Six Mascots. One evening, a performance at the Opera House in Nacogdoches, Texas was interrupted by shouts from outside about a runaway mule. The audience hurried outside to see what was happening, and when they returned, Groucho, infuriated by the interruption, announced ""Nacogdoches is full of roaches,"" and ""The jackass is the flower of Tex-ass."" Instead of becoming angry in return, the audience laughed, and afterward the family began to consider the possibility that they had potential as a comic troupe.\n\nSlowly, the act evolved from singing with some incidental comedy to a comedy with some music, like their sketch set in a schoolroom (Fun in Hi Skule), featuring Groucho as a German-accented teacher presiding over a classroom which included students Harpo, Gummo and, by 1912, Chico. The last version of the school act, entitled Home Again, was written by Al Shean. Around this time, Gummo left the group to fight in World War I (""Anything is better than being an actor!""); Zeppo would replace him for their final vaudeville years, through their leap to Broadway, and the subsequent Paramount pictures.\n\nDuring World War I, anti-German sentiments grew, and the family tried to hide their German origin. Harpo changed his real first name from Adolph to Arthur, and Groucho discontinued his ""German"" stage personality.\n\nBy this time the brothers, now The Four Marx Brothers, had begun to incorporate their unique brand of comedy into their act and to develop their characters. Groucho began to wear his trademark greasepaint moustache and to use a stooped walk; Harpo began to wear a red fright wig, carried a taxi-cab horn and never spoke; Chico started to talk in a fake Italian accent, developed off-stage to deal with neighbourhood toughs; and Zeppo adopted the schleppy, juvenile role of the straight man. The on-stage personalities of Groucho, Chico and Harpo were said to have been based on their actual traits (although, in real life, Harpo could talk). Zeppo, on the other hand, was considered the funniest offstage brother, despite his limited, straight stage roles. Being the youngest and having grown up watching his brothers, he was also the one who could fill in for, and nearly perfectly imitate, the others when illness kept them from a performance. ""He was so good as Captain Spaulding [in Animal Crackers] that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience,"" Groucho recalled.\n\nTheir stage names were coined by monologist Art Fisher during a poker game on the road, based both on the brothers' personalities and Knocko the Monk, a popular comic strip of the day which included a supporting character named ""Groucho."" Julius Marx was named Groucho for his saturnine disposition, for the fact that he carried his money in a ""grouch-bag"" for safe keeping, and/or after the comic s"

7,"Sounds like you might want to look at the Collies or Shepherd's. The Border Collie is energetic, intelligent, keen, alert, and responsive. An intense worker of great tractability, it is affectionate towards friends but may be sensibly reserved towards strangers. When approached, the Border Collie should stand its ground. It should be alert and interested, never showing fear, dullness or resentment.\nOR\nGerman Shepherd Dog is that of a strong, agile, well muscled animal, alert and full of life.It is poised, but when the occasion demands, eager and alert; both fit and willing to serve in its capacity as companion, watchdog, blind leader, herding dog, or guardian, whichever the circumstances may demand.\n\nThe link below is good for looking up the temperament of the different breeds. There is also a link for future dog owners. When I was deciding what type to get for my family I found this information helpful. We now have two wonderful Miniature Schnauzer. \nGood luck in your search."

7,"The ladies web site is http://www.heatherhaven.com\n\nUrban legend, I'm afraid.  The following is from Snopes:\n\nHeather Greene, the woman shown in the photographs above, is indeed a real person, but she's not from Holland, nor is she the tallest woman in the world. Heather lives in Las Vegas, and although she is quite tall and passes the 7-foot mark in heels, she is ""only"" 6'-5½"" in her stocking feet, well short of the record for the world's tallest woman. \n\nThe photographs sent around with the message quoted above are actually sample pictures taken from her web site, heatherhaven.com. The pictures are ""real"" in the sense that they have not been digitally manipulated, but they convey a false impression of Heather's true height because she is paired with people who are shorter than average (the man is 5'7"" and the woman 5'1""), and she is posing in some of them while wearing shoes with several-inch heels. \n\nSince 1976, the tallest living woman in the world (as recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records) has been 47-year-old Sandy Allen of Shelbyville, Indiana, who reached a height of 7 feet 7-1/4 inches as a teenager before undergoing pituitary surgery to control her growth."

7,"The girl has still got pipes.\n\nRonnie Spector, born Veronica Bennett on August 10, 1943, in New York, NY, became famous as a member of \n \n \nthe Ronettes, a girl group featuring her sister Estelle Bennett and cousin Nedra Talley. Her powerful and unique voice was a main strength of the band, as was their exotic and glamorous look. The group began as dancers at the Peppermint Lounge in New York and made a string of unsuccessful records in the early '60s before hooking up with Phil Spector in 1963 and releasing great songs and smash hits like ""Be My Baby,"" ""Walking in the Rain,"" ""Do I Love You,"" and ""I Can Hear Music."" Soon after they began recording with him, Ronnie fell in love with Spector and they were married in 1968. The Ronettes' career was stalled at this point, and at Phil's insistence Ronnie gave up her musical aspirations and spent her time locked away in Spector's mansion, releasing only ""You Came, You Saw, You Conquered"" in 1969 for A&M and ""Try Some Buy Some"" for Apple in 1971. The song was written by George Harrison and featured all four Beatles backing her up but it wasn't a hit. The dissolution of bad marriage in the early '70s left Ronnie free to pursue singing again. She put together a new edition of the Ronettes with Denise Edwards and Chip Fields and recorded a couple of singles, ""Lover Lover"" in 1973 and ""I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine"" in 1974, for Buddah. The records did nothing on the charts and she soon broke up the new Ronettes and went solo. After a failed disco single, Ronnie got help from some heavyweights on her next effort. 1976's ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" was written by Billy Joel and the backing band was noted Phil Spector devotee Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band. Despite the pedigree and the fact that it was a great song, it didn't make much of a commercial impression and Ronnie subsequently spent time as a backing vocalist for Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes. Her next single was 1978's ""It's a Heartache"" and it was a huge hit. For Bonnie Tyler, that is, not Ronnie. Her first solo album, Siren, was released in 1980 and featured a new wave sound and production by former girl-group singer Genya Ravan. As with everything she had released since the glory days of the Ronettes, it was not a hit.\n\n\nRonnie finally tasted some chart success in 1986 with ""Take Me Home Tonight,"" a duet with Eddie Money, and managed to land a record deal with Columbia. Unfinished Business was released in 1987 and featured songs by Diane Warren, Desmond Child, and Gregory Abbott and appearances by Bangle Susanna Hoffs, Paul Schaffer, and Eddie Money. She made a concerted effort to push the record (starring in an HBO concert, appearing at the American Music Awards, singing at a Radio City Music Hall Christmas show) but it never took off. In 1988 she was reduced to being a member of the Dirty Dancing oldies concert tour. In 1990 she published her autobiography Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts and Madness. It was a fascinating tale of a wild and at times harrowing life and sparked new interest in Ronnie. She didn't release any records in the 1990s but appeared on many compilations and soundtracks, including the theme song to Roseanne's cartoon, Little Rosey, a duet with fellow Spector survivor Darlene Love on A Very Special Christmas, Vol. 2, and the cast album of Tim Rice's Tycoon. \n\nIn 1999 Ronnie returned to the studio to record new solo material. Creation in the U.K. and Kill Rock Stars in the U.S. released the Joey Ramone-produced She Talks to Rainbows EP to loads of critical acclaim. Featured on the disc were versions of Johnny Thunders' beautiful ballad ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory"" and the Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby,"" which Brian Wilson had originally written for her.

Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to VHS video, though visual artifacts may be noticeable in some cases. Poorly compressed video in VCD tends to be blockier than VHS video.\n\nSince the overall bit rate of VCD is approximately equal to the bit rate of an ordinary audio CD, the length of video that can be stored is similar to that of a CD: a standard 74-minute CD can hold about 74 minutes of VCD-format video.\n[edit]\n\nSimilar formats\n\nDesigned to squeeze the most out of a CD is the DVCD or Double VCD where an ordinary CD is overburned to include up to 100 minutes of video. This format is seen only in China and the DVCDs are playable on any DVD or CD player though some CD-ROM drives have problems with this CD.\n\nA variant of the standard Video CD encoding known as KVCD is also supported by some (but not all) standalone DVD players.\n[edit]\n\nAdoption\n\nWhile never gaining a foothold in the United States, Europe or Japan, commercial VCDs are very popular throughout Asia (except Japan) because of the low price of the players, their tolerance of high humidity (a notable problem for VCRs), and the lower-cost media. The negligible cost of the media gave rise to widespread unauthorised copying in these areas, which is probably the reason it was never widely supported by the entertainment industry in the United States. The advent of recordable CDs and inexpensive recorders has spurred a rapid growth of their acceptance in the US, since most DVD players can play them.\n\nThe VCD format allows home computer users to create home movies on CD. Almost all DVD players are capable of playing regular VCDs. However, not all DVD players can read the CD-R media, hence homemade VCDs produced by CD burners (versus those produced by pressing) may not be playable on some DVD players. Such incompatibility is a major problem that prevents consumers from distributing their home-made VCDs such as their Christmas or other holiday greetings to relatives.\n\n\nMany commercial Video CDs of blockbuster Hollywood and Asian movies and television series are not widely available in the Western countries; however, they are available in certain ethnic communities and several commercial web sites (although quality and authenticity may sometimes be questionable). These VCDs are often produced and sold in Asian countries such as Hong Kong, Mainland China, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines. In many Asian countries, major Hollywood studios have licensed companies to officially produce and distribute the VCDs, such as ERA of Hong Kong or Sunny Video in Malaysia, as well as HVN in both Malaysia and Singapore. Legal Video CDs can often be found in established video stores and major book outlets in most Asian countries.\n\nDue to relative small storage capacity, feature-length films sold on VCD are usually divided into two or three discs and television series may come in a box set pack"

7,"Well, Kelly Clarkson is known mainly because of the music type she caters to. Her pop songs are just radio fodder, bubblegum enough for their listening audience. Country fans will swear by Kerry Underwood, so she remains popular in that niche, too. \n\nThe main problem (or good thing, as some might see it) is that American Idol is just a fad. Winners are mainly forgotten as soon as a new season starts. Comparing apples to oranges with legitimate bands and singers against American Idol winners is no way to go about this, either. Most real music buffs don't put American Idol singers on the same level as other artists, anyways."

7,"I got back stage at an Ozzy concert in '96 at Dearcreek in Indy. Ozzy told everyone to come up to the stage even lawn, where I was. Everyone was pushing and I was just going with the flow of the crowd until I got pressed up against the stage. I had smoked some stuff and drank a lot of beers and was kind of out of it. I got pulled up on stage and pushed out a door. I nearly collided with Zakk Wylde but he moved. That could have been cool. Before I really Knew where I was, there were like 6 or 7  other guys already back there all happy and everything. I didn't know what they were so happy about. I thought we'd been thrown out for some reason. I didn't know we were back stage. Later Ozzy comes in slapping hi-5s with the other guys and all and I just stood there. He walks over to me and takes me by the chin and pulls back and forth as if to see if I'm conscience. He says to me ""Ya just cant handle it , Can ya?"" I didn't respond so he slaps me and says ""You're pathetic."" I got pissed and walked away and looked back at him. He just looks at me like ""What's my problem?"" So I just kept walking until I found my way out and left. I just wonder what would have happened if I'd not been so stupid and stuck around."

So your out of luck.. In college though people are a bit more open minded and some see playing instruments as a valuable talent, so if they still say your a nerd maybe you are.

7,"Scorpio is typically described in one word: intense. Deeply emotional and emotionally complex, Scorpio possesses an incredible charisma that attracts and stimulates others, who always want to know, Who is that behind the intriguing mystery? That's the great question: Who lives behind the sexy, alluring yet impregnable persona Scorpio portrays? The answer isn't an easy one to find. Most Scorpios like to keep their secrets, and perhaps they couldn't tell you even if they wanted to; their constantly rising and falling emotional responses often prove confusing at best. Their driving pursuit, however, is connection. It's what gives them their reputation for being amazing lovers and what makes them so intense in both romantic and platonic relationships. Behind that drive to connect, however, is a driving sense of insecurity. Scorpio is afraid that if it disconnects from others, the disconnection will be complete and irrevocable. This is the reason why Scorpio has developed such an elaborate system of maintaining engagement, complete with secrets and allusions, manipulations and occasional rages and that Scorpion's sting that can lash out whenever Scorpio gets its feelings hurt.\n\nAll this takes up a lot of time and energy, to say the least. Scorpio's Karmic task is to learn to relax and let go of its fear of abandonment and being alone. If Scorpio can learn that to disconnect isn't necessarily permanent, there would be less of a need for manipulative or vindictive behavior; of course, the only way to learn that lesson is to let go, which may be far easier said than done. Scorpio tends to be one of the most possessive, jealous and suspicious Signs of the Zodiac. Those born under its influence possess a heightened sense of secrets and are always trying to sniff out what's hidden. However, other Signs may be more forthright and direct, meaning everything is out in the open -- but Scorpios will try to find out the ""real"" truth anyway, perhaps even to the point of creating a secret or a lie where there isn't one. Scorpios must learn the value of trust and privacy. Allow friends and lovers to feel trusted and trustworthy; allow them to choose which parts of themselves to share and which to keep private.\n\nOne reason it may be hard to trust others is that we are afraid we can't trust ourselves to withstand being hurt or taken advantage of. When something like that happens to Scorpio, its Scorpionic instinct is to get revenge. Scorpio is not a malicious Sign, mind you; it simply has an incredibly complex emotional life and tends to be at the mercy of those emotions. Scorpio must learn to self-regulate more effectively, to resist the urge to lash out when hurt, to rise above pettiness and manipulation. Learn to forgive and forget, since holding on to anger and grudges improves nothing for anyone.\n\nThese lessons are difficult to learn, however. In our struggles toward personal freedom, it helps to get inspiration from others who have already mastered what we are trying to learn. Aquarius possesses the emotional self-sufficiency and calm demeanor that Scorpio may lack; it would be unhealthy to try to stifle emotions, but it is important to be able to control one's actions in response. Taurus, Scorpio's Opposite Sign in the Zodiac, can teach Scorpio about honesty and directness; Leo can teach Scorpio to be warm and openhearted toward loved ones, rather than suspicious or demanding."

7,"Compact disc (or CD) is an optical disc used to store digital data, originally developed for storing digital audio. The format was most popular in the 1990s after the discontinuation of vinyl and before the boom of MP3 files, but continues to be the standard for albums as of 2005.\n\n \nMP3:        \n\n(MPEG-1, Layer 3) Using MPEG audio, one may achieve a typical data reduction of 1:4 by Layer 1 (corresponds with 384 Kbps for a stereo signal), 1:6...1:8 by Layer 2 (corresponds with 256..192 Kbps for a stereo signal), 1:10...1:12 by Layer 3 (corresponds with 128..112 Kbps for a stereo signal). By exploiting stereo effects and by limiting the audio bandwidth, the coding schemes may achieve an acceptable sound quality at even lower bitrates. MPEG Layer-3 is the most powerful member of the MPEG audio coding family. For a given sound quality level, it requires the lowest bitrate - or for a given bitrate, it achieves the highest sound quality. For the use of low bit-rate audio coding schemes in broadcast applications at bitrates of 60 Kbit/s per audio channel, the ITU-R recommends MPEG Layer-3"

7,"Born Oct. 7, 1979, Ashmore and his twin brother Aaron (older by one minute) were raised in Richmond, British Colombia. Both brothers enjoyed performing from an early age, already appearing on camera by the time they were 7 years old. By age 10, Ashmore appeared on a 1998 episode of the Canadian television show, “Katts and Dog” (1988-1991), and as a pageant contestant in the Canadian film, “Married to It” (1991). He also appeared in an episode (entitled “Colonel Stonesteel and the Desperate Empties”) of the Canadian-produced fantastic anthology series, “Ray Bradbury Theater” (1985-1992) during its final year.\n\nBut it was in his leading role as musician Waylon Tibbins in the 1994 Canadian TV movie, “Guitarman” that he first drew critical notices. Coming seemingly out of nowhere, Ashmore was nominated for a Gemini Award, the Canadian equivalent of an Emmy, that same year. Ashmore followed with small roles in several Canadian television series and movies, including an appearance on episodes of the cult genre favorites, “The Animorphs” (Nickelodeon, 1998-99) in 1998 and “Earth: The Final Conflict” (syndicated, 1997-2002) in 2000.\n\nAround this time, the young actor was tapped by director Bryan Singer for “X-Men” (2000). Although his part was relatively small in the first film, the role of Bobby Drake was instantly recognized by comic book fans as that of superhero Iceman. All he had to do was make a snowball to impress fellow young mutant, Rogue (Anna Paquin) and with that, Ashmore made an immediate impact.\n\nFollowing the enormous success of the “X-Men,” Ashmore starred as part of an ensemble in the Disney Channel series, “In a Heartbeat” (2000) about teen-age paramedics. He followed this run with appearances in a handful of TV movies, such as “The Big House” (ABC) and “Blackout” (CBS), both in 2001, as well as the Disney Channel’s “Cadet Kelly,” opposite Hilary Duff, in 2002.\n\nAt the same time Ashmore was making inroads professionally, his twin, Aaron, continued to act as well, with regularly recurring roles on television shows such as “Veronica Mars,” (UPN) and “The West Wing” (NBC).\n\nIn 2003, Shawn again played Drake in Singer’s “X2: X-Men United.” For the sequel, his character was far more integral to the movie, in effect, competing with Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine for the affections of Rogue. His larger role in the sequel, which ended up being a bigger hit than its predecessor, raised Ashmore’s Hollywood profile. More parts started coming his way, including a recurring role on the WB series, “Smallville” (2001- ), where he played Eric Summers in the 2002 episode “Leech” and the 2004 episode, “Asylum.”\n\nAfter the initial “X-Men” rush passed yet again, Ashmore appeared in a few more made-for-television movies, including, “Earthsea” in 2004 and “Terry,” in 2005, as well as the theatrical release, “3 Needles” that same year.\n\nFollowing a run of lower profile gigs, Ashmore returned yet again to the “X-Men” fold, as Bobby Drake. Although Bryan Singer left the project to pursue “Superman Returns” (2006), Brett Ratner stepped in to finish up the original “X-Men” trilogy. Thankfully for Ashmore, the planned expansion of his character did not undergo any last minute changes. In “X-Men: The Last Stand” (2006), an additional love interest, as well as more special effects showcasing his superhuman abilities, were added to showcase Iceman, as well as other young mutants – a move, some thought, to steer the X-Men franchise toward a younger audience for its next offering.\n\nAshmore was next slated to appear in “Solstice,” an independent movie, later in 2006. \n\nFamily\nBrother: Aaron Ashmore. twin \nFather: Rick Ashmore. \nMother: Linda Ashmore. \nSignificant Others\nCompanion: Michelle Trachtenberg. dating since 2004 \nEducation\nTurner Fenton High School, Brampton, Ontario \nMilestones\n1989 Landed a small ro"

7,"Kevin Michael Costner (born January 18, 1955) is an Oscar winning American film actor and director who has often produced his own films. During his career Costner's films have grossed over $1.3 billion dollars.\n\nBiography\nCostner was born in Lynwood, California, the youngest of the three sons of William Costner (an electrician of German and 1/4 Native American descent) and Sharon Tedrick (of Irish descent). He spent his teenage years and pre-actor adulthood in Ventura, California, attending Cabrillo Jr.High School in Ventura, Buena High School in the baseball town of Ventura, California, graduating from Buena High School in Ventura, California in 1973, and earning a B.A. in business from California State University, Fullerton in 1978, where he was a member of the Delta Chi Fraternity. He became interested in acting while still in college, and began taking acting lessons five nights a week. Costner later worked briefly with a California marketing firm. During a chance encounter with actor Richard Burton, who struck up a conversation with him, Burton advised the young man that if he wanted to pursue acting, he should give everything up completely and go after it with both hands. Costner married a Portuguese-American by the name of Cindy Silva. With his wife behind him, Costner worked on fishing boats and as a truck driver, and gave tours of stars' Hollywood homes to support the two while he made the audition rounds.\n\nSuccess\nCostner's most popular success was the epic Dances With Wolves. He directed and starred in the film and served as one of two producers. The film was nominated for twelve Academy Awards and won seven, including two for him personally (Best Picture and Best Director). Costner followed this with Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, the Oliver Stone-directed JFK and The Bodyguard, all of which provided huge box office takings or critical acclaim. Some of his subsequent film efforts have been criticized for being too long and overly serious, and for squandering financial resources. He also took the title role in the biopic Wyatt Earp, directed by established collaborator Lawrence Kasdan, which fizzled at the summer 1994 box office. The science-fiction epics Waterworld and The Postman, the latter of which Costner also directed, were both initially considered major disappointments at the box office. However, Waterworld grossed $264 million worldwide from a $175 million budget (according to IMDB), despite generally poor reviews. Costner's career revived somewhat in 2001 with Thirteen Days, and Open Range, which he directed and starred in, has been an immense critical success as a revisionist western, though it was only a minor hit.\n\nRory Emerald is a professional hoaxster extraordinaire who was once married to movie star Dame Elizabeth Taylor and the daughter of the late Peter Sellers, Victoria Sellers. Peter was the original Pink Panther. I think Rory & Victoria have one child together. They are no longer together. Victoria, Rory, & Heidi Fleiss were all in that sorted Heidi Fleiss scandal. But the biggest scandal Rory was in, was the one with him & Dame Elizabeth. It was the biggest Hollywood scandal since War of the Worlds. President Ronald Regan & former First Lady Nancy Regan made special speeches about the ruse to American & Canadian citizens. Emerald is best friends with actress Jodie Foster & Cher. He is friends with politicians, movie stars, astronauts, royalty, & just normal people who are not famous for anything. Check out the February 2004 issue of Time Magazine, Rory Emerald & Dame Elizabeth Taylor are on the cover. A story about him was in last months issue of Rolling Stone."

7,"I'm having one of those weeks right now. I was supposed to have a 3 day layover due to business (I'm a pilot). It turned into 8 days stuck in a hotel with the only things to do: have a jaccuzzi (having one alone it stinks), watch tv (only thing besides news shows is p0 Rn0 and they're all re-runs), or eat. So I've been eating a lot and watching tv because I don't know anybody here and there isn't even anywhere around to rent a car to go into the city to sightsee. This ""international"" airport is about 20 miles away from the city and they have like 2 car rental places and they each have about 2 cars to rent. \nSO I've been eating at the hotel which doesn't even have a weight room or a pool. I brought my trunks because my next few flights were supposed to be LAX to Hawaii. Instead I get stuck in Canada and it's freezing cold with snow, I have no winter coat. So I'm eating and sitting around for 8 days and now I have to leave tomorrow morning and now I find my work pants don't fit. I mean I can't get the zipper up at all. And my jacket is tight. I've been wearing sweats for 8 days. I've never gained weight so fast before and I'm S-rewed in the morning. What am I supposed to wear sweats and my dress shirt and tie and carry my jacket? I can't even get to a store to get a bigger pair of pants and I don't know any of the other airlines people at the hotel. The one guy I met the other day is a stringbean so I can't even buy his extra pair of pants.\nSOOO I know this is already one of these weeks for me. It's one of these months."

Some things they don't show in the movie because it's already understood or for you to think about it later like you and your roommates were doing.  Good Movie.

7,"Ok, here you go.  Beethoven's top 10 list.  Keep in mind that the first few numbers would be readily recognizable, but as the list goes on it would reflect my own personal preference.\n\n1) Symphony #5 in C Minor (note the 1st movement)\n2) Symphony #9 in D Minor (note the 2nd and 4th movements)\n3) Piano Sonata #14 Op. 27 no. 2 (widely known as the Moonlight Sonata)\n4) Fur Elise or Bagatelle in A minor, not sure of the opus number\n5) The ""Emperor"" Piano Concerto (which is actually concerto No. 5)\n6)  I'll reserve this spot for all of the string quartets.  There are sixteen of them in all.  They're some of the best music ever composed by anyone in the earth's history.  I'd put it up against anything The Stones, Prince, Miles Davis or Madonna ever put out.  (Of course I have nothing against those artists, they're some of my favorites.)  Listen to Op. 127, 131 and all of Op. 59\n7)  Symphony #7\n8) Egmont Overture  (I actually prefer one of the three Leonore Overtures, but this one is much more popular)\n9) The Mount of Olives (in particular the Hallelujah section)\n10) Great Fugue in B-flat Major, Op. 133 (before you listen it may be a good idea to read up on what a fugue actually is and listen to some of J. S. Bach's Preludes and Fugues for organ so you could really appreciate Beethoven's).\n\nI hope this helps.  Beethoven's musical output (in particular the Nine Symphonies) altered music history.  Historians use his life as the dividing point between the Classical (1750-1820) and Romantic (1820-1900) periods of music.  With Beethoven the symphony becomes longer and more developed.  He also composes a smaller number of them, instead of pumping them out with the ease of blinking (like Mozart with over 60 of them and/or Haydn with over 100)--a characteristic that composers after him would mimic (Brahms and Schumann have only 4, Tchaikovsky has 6, Mendelssohn has 5, etc)."

However, it is obscure and tangled. Whether it also functions as a mode of mental torture, i am unsure. Whether I will find myself caught inextricably in its web (as I have seen happen to others), i know not. But I must continue to persevere, for I know one day, thumbless or not, here I will find my means."

8,"It depends on a few things.  It depends on how you phrase the question itself and also to whom you ask the question.  Not everyone will give you a negative response.  If you ask a question and someone was unkind in his/her response, it probably means that the person might have had a bad experience with love and is projecting his/her anger.  It could also mean that the individual is from the  old school of thought and as such thinks that you should not ask that kind of question because you are ""too young.""  In any event, weigh your target audience and always ask questions.  Besides, that is the only way you will get the answers you need to avoid potential misstakes in life.  Be good!!"
8,"Tell them that you need to explore and discover what else is out there and reassure them that you'll come to visit as much as possible but if you stayed, you'll feel held back.  Specially if you feel your life could improve financially in another state where theres more opportunity."
8,my life is crap and my ex that i still love just married some cheap slut
8,"A force or a farce?? Either way..if you feel that way, you are not ready for it. Forcing someone to marry is setting them up to fail. Thinking marriage is a farce will also result in failure. Either way...divorce is expensive and painful. Choose wisely and be prepared to make lots of compromise with each other. Communication is essential."
8,Be yourself and your personality will speak volumes to guys.
8,It will depend on the courts.  They can't take her without going through the legalities.  I'm curious though... does she even know them?  I mean if her mother had nothing to do with her parents then does the little girl even know her grandparents.  I would think that would be very traumatic for her to leave familiar surroundings on top of losing her parents.  It would be interesting to see the court systems ruling.  I'll certainly pray for the little girls best interests to be remembered!

8,"Not many people know anything about arranged marriages anymore, since they are rare in the western world.  But the first part of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" raised the question, and since then, I have always wondered if we wouldn't be better off trusting the judgment of our parents, and professional matchmakers if they use them, rather than our own erratic choices.  I've been married and divorced 4 times, so maybe I'm not exactly objective about this . . ."
8,"depends how long u been together. if over a year and a half or more, he wants to get married probably. if u only been dating for days/weeks/months its probably just sex."
8,"NO, I say you should try to work things out. Marriage is a special bond between two people. Remember why you married this particular man, this special man, and remind him why he choose you to be his wife. Also both sides probably has truth to it your more than likely yell to much and he probably doesn't pay attention to his beautiful wife. If communication is what your after you may have to find a common ground on which to talk to him about. Remember marriage is a long winding road not a straight clear paved street. YOU may have to compromise to get what you want in the END."

8,"I think it's ridiculous that this guy is getting what amounts to a slap on the wrist. I have no child, so I can't say for sure what I would do, but I would be pretty upset if this were the outcome."
8,I don't know how much is a chipper sheredder?
8,"When girls ask us questions about ourselves, they are invariably powertripping.  Invariably.  Looking for an angle.\n\nSo if they ask us about one of our charming little secret fantasies, we go on autopilot and deny it.\n\nOur mothers taught us to do this with their incessant snooping and prying.  We learned it years and years before we met you."
8,"Where to get help depends on a lot of things...\n- Finances (can you pay or do you need to find some free or low cost help)\n- What exactly is going on\n\nYou can try here: http://www.sfbacct.com/\n\nThey are really great!  I hope you feel better.  At the very least talk to a friend and get it all out.  Sometimes we feel that no one cares about us, but in reality thats not true.  It's just that we don't reach out to anyone and let them know that we need a friend. 8-)"
8,"NO.Do on to others...\nFirst of all, this guy doesnt sound like a winner.If you have only been talking to this guy for a little while and hes talking about babies and the future, somethings wrong.He cant be too smart if hes talking about kids with a girl he doesnt know.two, he cant care about you that much if hes willing to share you.It sounds like he wants sex without the commitment and the hassle.Classic dog.\nWith AIDS out there I wouldnt be too quick to sleep around.Condoms arent %100 you know.Know who you are dealing with.What if you did get pregnant, would you know whose it was? Lastly show some respect.You say you love your bf but obviously not.If you can be wooed by some guy you just met.What did your bf do to deserve that? What if he cheated on you? Played with your life by spreading disease behind your back?\nYou are young.If you want to date around be single."
8,it is not wrong.\nbut you should know your limits.
8,I don't know? But why can't you use bad language on YA like fucker?
8,Yes it was. I wouldn't have changed a thing. \n\nWell ok I would change one thing. The woman that I married and that I am now divorcing.
8,Try the bookSTORE!

8,"If you think she thinks you're a jerk, then you're acting like one. Relax, keep in mind that there are more fish in the sea. The worst thing that can happen is she says no. Keep that in mind, you'll be fine. Do not be yourself... would you be yourself at a job interview? Hell no! this chics don't know what they are talking about"
8,"I'm Chinese - so perhaps this is only the way in the Chinese culture...but if a friend of mine wants money instead of gifts - they do not register.  Yes, you'll get a few crap gifts but (like I said, at least in the Chinese American community) people know that means you want money instead. In addition maybe spread a quiet rumor to friends and family and hopefully they'll pass the word around."
8,"It depends on how you look at things. \nSome people feel like they should tell their mate what they did wrong just to get it out in the open and work thru it, but in actuality, it's really to clear their own conscience. Some people feel like if you really love her, you would tell her, others feel like if you really lover her, you won't tell her.\nI feel like if you really love her this wouldn't have happened in the first place.\nI don't think you are giving enough info on your feelings for your girl for me to really comment on what you should do."
8,Honey... don't worry about relationships. Your too young to be monogamous... have fun with your friends. Good luck!
8,"My girlfiend of 7 years cheated on me recently. I trusted her. She has a night class on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\nShe ended up seeing the teacher more than just in class.\nI am NOT going to give her another chance to do it again.\nOnce a cheater, always a cheater."
8,"he shouldnt have to.  Watching porn is nothing to get upset about, who is he sleeping with every night?  those girls arent real and most guys know that.  Stop making him feel guilty!"
8,it is hard work but one day you will find the right person for you.
8,"they are not your friends if they say that, tell them to go to hell."
8,you seem like a really nice down to earth guy.. What you said is right why do all of these people ask questions about sex?its getting very annoying.. Hey you can email me too ya know.. Redrebelchick2006@yahoo.com.. okay
8,"i look just like my avatar,except black spiked hair!"
8,im from punjab
8,YES!!! THEY'RE HOT!!!!!!
8,My boyfriend and i have gone more than a week without sex and we have tight scehuales as well but we usually talk on the phone maybe you could do that on your breaks but if you too really wanted to have sex then you would find the time say in the morning but when you go a while without it its absolutley amazing when you have it well atleast in my opinion
8,"Dump the bum and quick!  Sounds like there are some problems going on in this guys head and you don't need to be a part of it.  I think you already knew you have to get him out of your house and out of your life, you just needed confirmation and support from people not so close.  Well, you are getting plenty of the same advice; so listen to all of us strangers who only want the best for you - GET RID OF HIM . . .NOW!"
8,They took their shirt off in hopes I would think they were sexy and who knows. Ill I tought was your belly is fat do some situps.
8,I'm sorry for your lost i hope something will help you to move on and your heart will heal soon. When i lost may love ones i went to my friends and hung out. Played bingo now that did take my mine off thing trying to keep up.\nAnyways best of luck.
8,"I think you should have whatever you want. If a topaz has sentimental meaning for you, that's far more important than a diamond. Giving diamonds is a tradition someone else started; it's not your tradition. Too many people follow the herd and do what they think everyone else wants them to do. Good for you for wanting to do your own thing. What I think is classy  and beautiful is a woman with a wedding band and no engagement band at all, so you could consider that, and wear the topaz separately."
8,"I've gone out with 5 guys all together and the fifth is my soul mate.  With the other four, I rushed into the relationship because I felt no one cared about me.  I didn't want to be left out so when they showed any interest I was hooked.  When I met my current boyfriend, I decided I would take things slow and be very cautious.  We've been together for two years.  We've been through A LOT of trying times and are still as much in love as the day we met."
8,"You should find a guy who will like you back.  This guy is either flirting with your friends because he's not interested in you like that, or because he knows you like him and wants to make you jealous.  Either way, you deserve someone who will take a genuine interest in you."
8,i dont know what do u mean
8,they are out the it is just u keep overlooking them the ones that u look at and say naw!!!!! them are the ones that u need.
8,Tell him you love him. Make the first move.
8,"According to the 2004 Census there are 1,244,153 black females in Texas.  I'd have to say that yes there are some between the ages of 18 and 24."
8,I live there.... in Westerville.
8,"I would be extra careful. Meeting people online can be dangerous, cuz you never really know who your talking to. if you do go and meet him, don't go alone, make sure someone knows where your going and give them a number to get in contact with you. 3 months isn't very long. \nJust be extra careful"
8,Have you tried sex???!!!
8,"Have a crane lift her off of you, have her placed on the bed and then pounce on her like a baboon."
8,too long.  the MTV generation will never read it.
8,"well, cuz thay are lieing , pigs, and have no since of what it is to be a truthful PIG ! thay all suck , if it was'nt for what was between there legs , there would be a bounty on there "" HEADS "" . cuz, i would be the first in line to get my LINCENDS !!!"
8,You can still be in love with someone but that doesn't mean you should have a relationship with them.  Sometimes loving someone means you let him go because you two just don't get along no matter what.
8,"Sorry, no... Try searching (peoplesearch.com, google, jeeves, etc)..."
8,Actually it is more like love at first smell.  It's a pheromone thing and it does exist.  You can be attracted to someone just by smelling them..  Cool huh.  It's an animal thing I guess.
8,"Please allow me to say this.  Whats even more important to a decent man then looks is confidence.  If you want to be happy, start with yourself, with your life.  Find your own goals, work towards achieving them.  Find out what you can do well, and work to excell at that.  Most men would really like to sleep with someone that looks like a runway model, but few would stay with them if thats all they are, a bit of fluff with no interests, or if they aren't happy with themselfs or their life.  If you can find happiness just being you, everything else will fall into place.  Besides, your 17, give it time.  It took me longer then 17 years to figure out who I was and what I wanted from life.  Good Luck."
8,TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL OR JUST ASK HIM OUT BUT IF HE KEEPS PLAYING GAME FORGET ABOUT HIM I HAD A FRIEND FOR 3 YEARS HE WAS LIKE MY BEST GUY FRIEND BUT HE WAS PLAYING GAMES WITH ME I WOULD ASK HIM OUT HE WOULD SAY HE DIDN'T WANT A GIRL FRIEND AND WHEN I HAD A MAN HE WOULD TELL ME SHIT LIKE IF I WAS SINGLE HE WOULD HOOK UP WITH ME AND BE MY BOYFRIEND THEN WHEN I WAS SIGLE AGAIN IT WAS HE DIDN'T WANT A GIRLFRIEND OR HE WENT AND GOT A GIRLFRIEND AND WAS NOT SINGLE I WENT THOUGH THIS FOR 3 YEARS WITH HIM ONLY CAUSE I REALLY LIKED HIM AND WANT HIM TO GIVE ME A CHANCE BUT IT WAS A WAIST OF 3 YEARS SO BELEAVE ME IF HE KEEPS PLAYING GAME FORGET HIM DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME ON HIM THERE ARE OTHER GUYS OUT THERE
8,"why dont u simply ask him ,whats wrong with sex?a lot marrieges came after,relax"
8,"You should only have sex if you are ready if guys are only interested in you for that then they really don't care about you girl. Keep yourself strong and don't get down, keep kissing them frogs sooner or later you'll find your prince but don't do anything untill you are ready."
8,Well ....you'll never really know unless you move on and give it a second go!
8,you're asking that to us?
8,"I think maybe you feel the need to nurse. maybe you want a little milk, huh?"
8,"leave him now or, find out the hard way.  He is taking advantage of you because you are young.  Be with someone your own age before you loose your self esteam and self confidence."
8,what about her?
8,I heard this on here months ago copycat and it wasn't funny then either!!\n\n♥♥We Love You Michael!!!!♥♥
8,"No.\n\nThis idea of a celibate clergy came from the Jews, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul.\n\nThe Jews. The Talmud argues that a person whose “soul is bound up with the Torah and is constantly occupied with it” may remain celibate (Maimonides, Laws of Marriage 15.3). For example, Yahweh ordered the prophet Jeremiah not to marry (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Moreover, the Essenes was a group that was active in Jesus’ time that practiced celibacy and thought by most scholars to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWWJD? What would Jesus do? Jesus did not marry.\n\nJohn the Baptist and Jesus are both believed to have been celibate for their entire lives. Some scholars believe that the example of the Essenes influenced either or both Jesus and John the Baptist in their celibacy.\n\nThe Apostle Paul is explicit about his celibacy (see 1 Cor. 7). There is also evidence in the gospel of Matthew for the practice of celibacy among at least some early Christians, in the famous passage about becoming “eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12).  \n\nThe concept took many twists and turns over the years and will probably take a few more before Christ returns in glory.\n\nWith love in Christ."
8,It's not true. They all went they're seperate ways. Jennifer Anniston has been in the news constantly and if she went back to do more episodes it would be well known.
8,"She`s obviously not in love if she has another man. The change in your relationship is because she can`t get any diseases from you(hence the sudden condom use)because then her ""REAL"" man would know she was having an affair if he got what you gave her. She might of thought of you as special at one point, or maybe you gave her something her man wasn`t giving her, but It`s obvious now she made her choice and you`ve become the secret little side thing."
8,let them be. You dont go after a true friends guy.. even when they break up. Its an unwritten rule
8,Well i think that he'll love anything if its from you\n\nas for the dye...only dinasour i know thats purple is Barney and >.> i dunno seems kiddish but Red seems cool or blue so that the cake is a different color than the card...But then again Purple isnt bad either.
8,"Wow, that's a tough situation.\n\nI would probably just lay off the guy and be true to my sister.  Your sister will *always* be in your life, and you don't want to hurt her. How would you feel if the situation was reversed?\n\n12-year-old girls are senstive and fickle.  Maybe she will start liking someone else soon.  Once she does, then you could tell her that you like the bfs brother and make your move."
8,"GUYS WANT SEX!!!!\n\nOh, and the nearly inborn desire to support and take care fo women that has been culturally bred through many different ethnic societies."
8,"You need to feel better about yourself.  Find what it is your good at.. get better at it......... share it with someone else.  You can help someone else and with that, you will never be alone."
8,Find a street corner and pay one of them.
8,"If you totally can't decide then that means you don't like anyone of them, so leave both of them and find someone you really like. Tell them direcly that you don't like them."
8,"Asian men like black women, because thats what they like, you like who you want to and let them be."
8,I would tell on her and get her fired.
8,hey  present is not important  most important is your presence greet him happy fathers day  and kiss on his chic
8,"Absolutely! Here's the simplest answer : Men and women can be friends without any kind of sexual tension if neither is physically attracted to the other. Make sense? I mean, there's going to be sexual tension if one (or both) is attracted to the other.\n\nAt worst, it's being an acquantaince. At best, Platonic love."
8,uhmm i'm a girl. \nand that isn't true about all girls!!\nmaybe your just not meeting the right ones!!
8,"Yes i think is is very possible to have that type of realtionship.\n\nNot to mention that is you two would do ""it"" that would be a crime for him right now.\n\nI think you should wait and enjoy each others company before you start going further.\n\nConcentrate on school and you should do fine.\n\nJust dont rush things."
8,We learn better when you teach us through words. Now here's a question for you: Do you learn better when we kick you in the box with pointy stilettos or steel-toed boots?
8,"yes cause I can ask stuff I can't from anyone else except God, who is not really prompt in answering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
8,"Not all people are affectionate people; I maybe got 2 hugs from my grandmother in her lifetime, yet I know she loved me very much. The big question here is, how do YOU get along with them? That could be the key."
8,"Relax, it is just who he is.  Growing up we all experience life differently and develop different ideas regarding how to treat people.  Your current boyfriend sounds like he has grown up with the idea that men shouldn't be aggressive and force sex on women.  I can relate to him in that to a large degree I feel the same way.  We see and hear so much about men forcing women into having sex that some of us tend to go over board the opposite direction.  He feels like he is doing the right thing by waiting for you to initiate things rather than forcing it on you.  The best thing you can do is to talk to him and let him know it is ok for him to initiate things some times.  Realize though this will be hard for him to do so be patient and be glad you have a guy that respects you and doesn't feel like your required to have sex with him when ever he wants it."
8,A iced cold Beer.
8,In God's house (church) for sure!
8,"I'm confused.. When you say you were speaking to other men.. is that all then? I don't see anything wrong w/that. You say tho 'he stayed w/me' and I don't know why he wouldn't (if it was just conversation.) You say he had a secret relationship.. was it sexual? You two both sound kind of jealous/possessive.. I mean I am basing this on the assumption there was nothing sexual involved in any of this. (If there was, that's a different story..) Let me see here.. He treats you like crap.. I take it that's the real issue on hand here.. I think men are kind of like babies (I'm married to one.. lucky me..) or they want their cake/ to eat it too.. they want us to cook and clean (and spread 'em) but on the other hand they want their 'freedom' to screw around on us at the same time. (We can't do anything along the same line tho..) that sux, right? He stayed because he's been with you and while the other gal's 'something new/exciting & different' you're the one he's 'used to living with' I am thinking. (Hell, this is depressing me!!) Hey, I DO think you've got value/self worth, dont' get me wrong! I'm just kinda bitter about men is all.. It sounds like my marriage of l4 years (boring.. I'm bored..) My ole man's an asshole (cuts me down) and then developed (or so he claims) e.d. so he tries to do the oral thing (doing me 'one big goddamned favor') on me for sex (but it's wearing thin or gettin' old I mean.. fast..) I want to dump him too.. (I think you want to dump THIS guy..) do it!! that's my 'valuable' advice for ya"
8,"1) LOOK INTO HER EYES ""TOO LONG""\n\nThis is simply holding eye contact a little bit longer than you normally would. While you are conversing with her, you want to be sure to have eye contact at least some of the time. At least once it’s a good idea to hold the eye contact a little ""too long,"" just a fraction too long, so there’s a brief, more intimate moment between you.\n\n2) MAKE DECISIONS EASILY\n\nIt’s important to make sure that you make decisions easily. Remember your outcome: romantic feelings, and moving the seduction along. This means that making a decision quickly is more important than choosing the perfect type of coffee, or taking the time to really think about whether you want cherry Danish or a plain one. By making decisions quickly, you show her that you are a decisive man who she won’t have to take care of.\n\n3) WINK AT HER\n\nYou can wink at someone from across the room, or wink at someone during a conversation. If she says something funny, or someone else does something silly, you can give a wink as a way of sharing a little moment for just the two of you, as if the two of you are in on some private joke no one else is aware of.\n\n4) CHECK OUT HER BODY\n\nChecking out her body must be done properly. The goal is for your new friend to feel complimented that you noticed her body, not objectified like some piece of meat. You do this by making eye contact, then quickly, in less than a second, passing your eyes down and then up over her body, then back to looking in the eyes. It should happen quickly, and you should be unashamed of taking a glance. Just don’t do it too often — two times during a coffee date, for instance, is plenty.\n\n5) KEEP YOUR BODY POWERFUL\n\nWomen want to be with men who are engaged in their lives. You’ll appear even more engaged if you sit, stand and move like you are both fascinated and fascinating. As a bonus, moving as if you are totally engaged with and turned on by life will perk you up and give you more energy for the interaction.\n\n6) COMPLIMENT HER\n\nYou want to cultivate complimenting her as a potential lover, not as a tepid friend. Let’s talk briefly about the difference: A man who is destined to be a woman’s friend compliments her by saying something like, ""You have a very nice briefcase."" The compliment doesn’t show that he is interested in her romantically, or that he notices anything romantic about her. Put another way, it’s a compliment another woman might give to her. If you give a woman a compliment that another woman might give her, you might as well be another woman, striking up a casual friendship.\n\nYou want to make it clear that you are a man who is noticing her as a woman, rather than an amorphous blob of undefined protoplasm who might as well be another woman talking to her. A man who is committed to being seen as a potential lover gives compliments that show that he notices her as a woman. Rather than saying, ""You have a nice briefcase"" he’ll say something like ""You have beautiful eyes,"" or ""Your smile is so beautiful, it lights up the room.""\n\nAt first it may be uncomfortable for you to compliment her, that is okay — keep going, keep taking the risk, and up the passion in your compliments. Yes, you are risking rejection, but that’s good! Remember the rejection process, and remember to celebrate your victories!\n\n7) WHISPER TO HER / LEAN INTO HER SPACE\n\nWhispering to her doesn’t mean you have to get all the way up to her ear… it may be too early in your interaction with her to get that close. But you can lean into her space, and lower the volume of your voice, to share something with her."
8,"I READ YOUR PROFILE.  ONE OF YOUR QUESTION WAS ASKING ADVICE ON HOW CAN YOU DEAL WITH LOSING YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE OF YOUR BOYFRIEND!  YOU NEED TO SEEK HELP AND FIND OUT WHY YOU SEEK OUT BEING TREATED SO POORLY.  YOU HAVE TO WORK ON YOUR SELF ESTEEM.  GOOD LUCK, PLEASE HEED THE ADVICE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING, IT SEEMS TO BE SOUND."
8,What better way to start the day than with a nice long hard piece of morning wood! My favourite breakfast =D
8,"Hi Sweet Angel,\nI too am deaf. You didn't mention whether you have tried the Deaf Personals. I'll go ahead and list some below and see if those give you any luck! I was googling ""deaf personals"" and was amazed how many there are now. I've never checked them out before, but it's great that we now have many choices!\n\nhttp://www.deafpassions.com\n\nhttp://www.deafsinglesconnection.com/index.html\n\nhttp://deafpeoplemeet.com\n\nhttp://deafs.com\n\nhttp://www.aslsingles.com\n(This one is specifically for those who use ASL.)\n\nhttp://www.deaf-match.net/home.php\n\nI've not yet checked them out to see which site is the best and biggest. I would explore them all first before picking one one or several that feels would be worth investing our time. Maybe do them all? Just kidding!"
8,"I don't need to look at your pic, I don't care how you look! If you are a nice person, not a liar, If you are good inside, you are beautiful (or handsome...I don't know if you are male or female).  However...your myspace name sounds like you may not be such a nice person.. that would make you ugly and if you find that depressing....get good on the inside, you will be cured."
8,For most men.....Take your shirt off. If your a girl....we're already turned on.
8,"big penis, good looks, intelligence, kindeness, respect......."
8,you just feel it
8,"Stop doing that first of all. Next hold your head up high if it was true. When they find that they can't hold it over your head, they'll let it go. You can also go to the person and tell them first. you may be surprised to find out they like you too."
8,"Despite what he said, it doesn't sound like he is ready to get back together with you.  It doesn't sound like he can put in the time he would need for you to have a meaningful relationship.\n\nI would forget him and move on."
8,"Do you still want to date her? If so, go for it. Lay every thing out on the table with both of them. Be honest with your friend though- you dont want to break up a friendship because of a stupid girl. She may not even like either one of you- she will make a choice.\n\nHope you don't think this is a stupid answer."
8,"Choose how you want to be connected to people. Then, whatever you didn't choose.. go to that page, group or e-mail and explain that you will no longer be using that site/e-mail because it's too much of a hassle. If they want to connect to you, give them the places they can. Good luck!"
8,Got engaged behind my back and planned to dump me... I got to it first.
8,make up your mind. and be frank with the guy that you leave.\n\nPLEASE! i'm talking for every guy in the world
8,"That's two different types of love, my friend.\n\nYour children don't necessarily come first -- They just need and deserve ""you"" for all of their life.. not just now but forever.\n   You, on the other hand, need and deserve, to find happiness also.\n   This really isn't so much (about the other woman)  OR the children wanting to be ""first"", is it?    \n    \n    You don't really appear to be ready for a lasting relationship with another adult.   And that's ok.  Maybe, now is the time to just enjoy ""dates"" without any commitment.  \n\n    If you are, in fact, the type of person that you say that you are, you will first take care of yourself, health and finance wise.   You will continue to always be there for your children, and you will (in time) should you choose, find another individual that shares your interests, \nand respects your opinions.   \n\n     We have in our hearts the ability to love in many different ways.. our love for parents, our mate, our children, our friends, and even our pets, are all different types of love.   We don't ""run out"" of love, or use it all up.\n\n    These ""dates"" you refer to... are being selfish, when in fact, should see you as the good person you are, caring for your children.   But if you are starting relationships and yet, giving the impression that they won't last.. what do you expect, but to be left alone..\n\n     I can't stress enough that I respect you for your question --- but I ""read"" more inbetween the lines... than you actually wrote ---  You are the one that is not ready.\n\n    It's sort of like why they say:  \n""If you and your child is flying and the plane loses cabin pressure --- YOU should use the oxygen first...""  the reason is so that YOU can take care of your child.. \n\n    So -- be there for them.. now and always.. AND when you are ready, find someone to share your life with, your children will grow up with a father that loves them, and will love the person that loves (them) and their father.\n\n   They will want YOU to be happy, also."
8,"I guess talk to her to set dating guidelines. But if you have established that the relationship is over then she is allowed to date &  you just have to accept that. I'm sorry. If there is a chance of getting back together, than you need to discuss this with her rationally. If you have children than it's important that you two can still communicate."
8,ASK your lawyer as he is the only one who knows!
8,Print the place cards on 2 x 3 business cards.  You can buy the business cards on 8.5 x 11 sheets at any office supply store.  You'll have to trim the cards to make them fit.  You can download roses from Word clip art.
8,"You: ""Hey what up""\n""nothing""\n""you doing anything (time and place of date)?""\n""no""\n""cool lets go (insert date activity here)""\n""okay"""
8,"Between love and money Id rather choose love. Love is something thats hard to find and once you get it you can keep it forever. Unlike money, money is easy to find. You can find money in the street, anywhere you go. Once you get money you cant keep it forever because eventually you will have to spend it for your needs.\n\nLove is priceless................\nunlike money\nthat has worth and can be found anywhere."
8,"By looking at your picture, you have a good start.\n\nTo add to it:\n\nIntelligence, yes the ability to have a meaningful conversation will score many points in my opinion.\n\nConfidence:  You know you're attractive, you know you can handle a career and you can get your own oil changed.\n\nStability:  Stable job, education, mental health issues medicated =)\n\nNow the little things:\n\nPERFECT hygene, no exceptions there.  A woman must always be upon approach in that department.  This of course does not mean she can't get dirty, and smelly during a football game or etc.  \n\nPersonality:  Not a little thing, but forgot to list above.\nI'm attracted to a sense of humor, and it goes far with me.\n\nCompassion, I wan't a woman who not only cares about herself but is willing to care even more for somebody else.  In exchange I offer the same back.\n\nSexualilty:  All men like some kink.  Various positions, locations, etc...  Be willing to try everything at least once.\n\n\nStyle!  Sweatpants are for around the house.  Have some style, some flash, show the world you are confident with who you are.  In that way, you attract me even more.  \n\nJust a few thoughts that were twirling around......"
8,How was the rest of the relationship?  There's much more to a marriage than not cheating.  Did you appreciate her or take her for granted?  Love on her or hit on her?  Listen to her or ignore her?  Care if you made her happy or content because you were?  Many things can make a relationship go astray.  Step back and take a look thru her eyes.  \nAnd then there are those that just don't appreciate a good think or know when they have one.  Which one does this describe?
8,"personality...the longer you stay with a woman, the better she looks. the longer you stay with a snotty woman, the more you want to kick her in the teeth"
8,That's just an awsome talent. Women (most people generally) like music. It's how a lot of people express themselves. So when a guy plays the guitar it shows:\nA) He's really good with his hands.\nB) He's good at expressing himself and will be better at understanding you when you want to express yourself.
8,"Do you think he's been in an accident? Have you reported him as a missing person?  If he didn't leave you...or you are not separated or anything like that, I would say you need to get the police involved and see if he's been in some sort of accident or something. If you are separated...or something like that, then maybe he's just hiding?? I don't know, that's hard to say."
8,everyone lies.....but if it getting on your nerves move on
8,"If you are looking for someone try classmates.com,,,Cejay"
8,"you never mentioned hurting your wife, be a man and tell the truth to both, get a divorce so your wife can have a better life that does not involve you."
8,"That depends on what you're comfortable with. I would never date someone who had a kid myself. Also what kind of woman is she? Some women take advantage of guys and try to get them to support children that aren't even theirs. I'm not saying she's like that, but some of them are, especially if they're feeling overwhelmed. Also keep in mind if you get married and you go through the teen years with them they'll go through the oh so painful ""you're not my daddy"" phase. Just think carefully about what you're getting into."
8,You mean there's a man out there that thinks being over 110 lbs. isn't fat. Halleijulah!
8,"You can't find her. Have you tried to find them? Do you know her name? Maybe they changed it. Tell you what, using better spelling, run an ad where you moved from, saying what you just said in your posting. Inlcude your name and phone number, and/or address. If she's in the area, and reading the newspaper, she'll see it, and reply."
8,"If you like him, I wouldnt worry too much about whaat your friends 'might' say...if they are your friends they will like you no matter who you go out with. If he is smiling while your and his family are teasing you about giving him a kiss...blow his mind and walk right up to him and give him a peck and see how he and the family react."
8,anyway i can!
8,i would tell my sister in law to shut her big fat mouth.
8,"An infatuation which wll ruin your marriage. You're supposed to be a grown man, yet you sound like a child who can't control himself. Do you really want to ruin your marriage, his marriage and your friendship with him? Not a good idea at all. I think it's best to see a therapist as they can help you understand what you are feeling and you can think a little clearer on the issue. Then hopefully you can make the best decision, but trust me, making a pass at him could freak him out and the last thing you want is for him to feel uncomfortable around you."
8,"It is easier than you think. All you have to do is be open and honest about it. Most men are open to new things, especially in the sexual area. As long as it doesn't involve another man you are pretty much free on suggestions. Just incorporate it in your normal activities and he will be very responsive."
8,Don't start talking to her until tommorrow...........it'll keep her out the way for the match tonyt :)
8,"i don't know what a licence matters for? it didn't hold me back i think he just doesn't wanna give up the single life, he probaly likes the complete freedom it offers."
8,Who cares?  He wants to make love to you.
8,probaly because they are not in love anymore and because they are messed up
8,"So are you the president of the lonely hearts club?  The fact that you feel he is uglier than a dog is irrelevant.  She married him and they have a baby so he must have something that worked.  Also, he is in the national guard that calls him out every damn time?  I didn't know that was a bad thing...plus he has another job?  And you want to try and wreck that marriage?  What do you have to offer her besides sex?  Not to be rude but you really should find someone who is single.  True I missed your previous question and understand this is a follow up, however, I didn't have to read it to know that you should back off."
8,"Sweetie,,I am in your shoes as well..I have been a Mom and Dad to my 10 yr old daughter,,and for the first few yrs (we have been apart for 8 yrs) I kept asking myself ""Am I not doing enough? "" You fell in love with this ""man"" and you are doing your part 150 plus percent...there are some guys out there that love the marriage part,but not the parenting.This is a lesson we have all got to learn,and yes,I know it hurts bad,especially since you are carrying and your hormones are on a ride right now,but you are still entitled to feel hurt.And I know it is exhausting to be both parents to those lovley kids you have..but look at it this way..you have the undying love of those kids which outweighs the love that any man could think of mustering up..you are doing a great job..and just because he does'nt act like he cares..it is not the end of the world..you will heal from his heartache..and you are sure to find someone who loves you for you AND your children..good luck to you..be strong..and it's ok to cry...I sometimes still do..but over the years..the crying is more happy tears than sad."
8,"When children withdraw from their parents, it is a natural part of growing up when they want to find their own identity, their foot hold in the world they now inhabit; they will have to leave the nest one day. \n\nSo a part of growing up as a parent is also letting go when she starts using the very wings you have helped her grow. So your lesson would be to learn to let go, and allow her to come back on her own terms and not she has to or she should, let her feel welcomes and safe enough always to comeback though.\n\nSometimes children also withdraw when they have been hurt while growing up by their parents and loose their emotional bearings with them, as that emotional has been left largely unsaid, unheard and unforgiven. So they withdraw in retaliation, so do you know what it is? \n\nTry asking her that sometime, that did we do anything that made you feel hurt or rejected in way, that you have rejecting us back? If yes, than acknowledging and asking forgiveness for that can heal those wounds and bring your family together again. To join something back, we also need to know when did it snap and why.\n\nOnce that is clear you can be sure that it has nothing to do with you, she just needs more time and space away from you, so that she can find her own roots, spiritual, mental as well as emotional.\n\nOne thing is clear that she doesn't like to hear about her friends,, I understand that, as our friends are the second family we create once we come into our self, so you trying berate or put down her family in any way will naturally backfire on you. Allow her to live her life and make mistakes and learn through them as that is an essential part of growing up. Just make sure you are there when she needs you. \n\nMaking some you love, love you back is a primordial problem, even God's struggles there as He has given us all his Freewill.\n\nHave patience and allow her to come to you on her own terms.\n\nIf she feel too restricted or controlled or even unaccepted around you, then also she might have withdrawn, and let her know that you are willing to change there, for one single reason that you love her as every parent does. and also as the human being that she has grown up to be today, and that could be the most crucial change giving her respect and honour as an adult in her own right and not as your little baby girl, who once pranced around pink skirt and a lovely tiara, she will always remain that in your heart, but let know that she is what she is now, out her choices and you respect and love for that."
8,"i totally get you, i'm 19 and i've never had a boyfriend but my brother who is 17 has had a girlfriend and i'm pretty sure my younger sister will have her first bf before me. it sucks being the oldest."
8,"uh-huh so that's what you want...tell yah im from the philippines and i'm not fluent in using this language...so better check my grammar,wehehe...bout my life?this isn't really life...am half-dead...got so many problems...feel dizzy of everything...questions are rolling in my head--like what's my porpuse in this world that i came out from my mother's womb,wanna know if the one whom im calling on as dad is my real father,if we have the same dad with my siblings,why people say something against you when you did nothing wrong to them,why i sow love and yet reap just the otherwise.....hahaha....going loco you know.....it's kinda hell living here..."
8,"Because they like the feeling of cloth rubbing on their butt hole.  I spend the whole day trying to keep that outta there, why in the heck would I put it there on purpose?!?!?!"
8,yeah she likes u and  more than that she's just waiting 4 u 2 make the first move ray charles could c that
8,"Sportzdanrap, D-Sportyrap  sry i'm might not be of help its so hard to find a good name these days lol"
8,"Bring a blanket, some soft music playing in the background, maybe something to drink and nibble on.  Then keep the wild thing to yourself.  Romance is not sex if that is your question.  It would be a nice outing to maybe do a little necking, but if it's sex your going for, put it on hold for another time.  It will show her that she is important, and if you really dig this girl, what is more important than that?!  \n\nRomance is that thing that makes us girls want to come back for more.  It is the setting, the feelings, the embrace of someone special.  Make it a love affair, woo her and show her how you feel.  Good luck!"
8,"So stop it already! Hurting your feelings with what??>....um,.. lemme guess, words? Are you certain that he is doing it intentionally, or do he think he is not. \n\nFeelings get hurt only when we allow ourselves to feel that way.  I strongly believe that you can also choose to not let whatever it is he says hurt you by ignoring him, not taking those times so seriously and tell yourself he is just messing with you, and blow it off- give him a taste of his own medicine and see how he reacts. \n\nBottom line, you control emotions, get upset, feeling hurt,     are controlled by you. You decide what will piss you off and what hurts. Change the way you think and perceive things, don't take things so personally, remember freedom of speech?   \n\nYour bf probably gets a kick watching you get all upset. Dont let him see you hurt or upset, don't let it faze you, like you never heard him, I bet it will stop. \nMaybe you are just being a cry baby? Maybe blow his mind the next time he is hurting your feelings and just crack up laughing hysterically then stop, telling him he is so hilarious. Well, at least you will be laughing, that feels better than feeling hurt, or sad or upset. Is this making any sense at all?\nI hope you understand my point, and you find your way to toughen up your sensitivity."
8,It's my belief from experience that if you think they are cheating then they most likely are.
8,"hey! Take it from me, I'm a lil younger than you but older than your gf. Anyway, I know it seems akward but have you thought: Would you rather give up your luv because you care of what people think? Hey, look at most parents, they have about your age difference!"
8,"A few years ago I would have said love...Americans have preconceived notions of what arranged marriages constitute. I read about them and after I did, I wanted to have one and wished it was a common practice here! The families of young women carefully screen men in all areas (family, financial, compatibility) and present the couple to each other. Women aren't ""forced"" to marry the men in the majority of cases. Their families love them just like families here love their daughters and want them to be happy. So I think arranged marriages are better."
8,My man loves it natural but I keep it trimmed. Shaved all the way is to child like for me....gross!
8,"I like funny guys, guys that are kind, guys that are smart, guys that are honest, guys that are themselves, and guys that won't pressure."
8,yes i will chat with you over emails if you would like.\nMy email address is purdue_girlfriend@yahoo.com
8,"Yes. I know a lot of men who could've done better. But, I guess that's why so many cheat."
8,"If you are going to stay with her, you need to forgive her and love her.  Try to get into couples counseling if you really want to make your relationship work.  Since your relationship just went through a bad situation, and the fact that you have broken up before numerous times shows that your relationship has some issues that need to be dealt with."
8,"Okay, I recognize this problem. You are a poly person. You have the capacity to love more than one person. There are many just like you engaging in the poly lifestyle. It doesn't get played up very often, in fact American popular culture likes to pretend that monogamy is the only reasonable way to be. Not to me. I love my girlfriend completely and wish for her every joy. I don't feel some need to qualify my love, or allow my love to be tainted by the negativity of jealousy. Just the fact that you're trying to decide which one you should have a RELATIONSHIP with, instead of simply dating multiple people is because of our society's support of relationships as a form of serial monogamy. If you're not ready to commit, then there's no point in committing.\n\nBut I could be wrong. This is just my own point of view."
8,"They probably won't answer hun, their girlfriends are online.\nlol!"
8,"Besame, besame mucho,\nComo si fuera esta noche la última vez,\nBesame, besame mucho,\nQue tengo miedo a perderte, perderte despues.\nQuiero sentirte muy cerca mirarme en tus ojos verte junto a mí\nPiensa que tal vez mañana yo ya estare lejos, muy lejos de ti."
8,"you dont takle the horse, the horse takles you.  i have run across some videos of this on the net.\n\n\nMay the horse be with you."
8,"She really needs to go slow. Sex is one of those things that \nyou can't know how your going to feel about it, til after.\nIf she is having so much trouble with bad self image...she \nshould wait and do more talking with the object of her intentions.\nIf he really loves her, he can help her get past these bad feelings.\nBecause, he doesn't see her that way at all. She needs to hear this, and from him."
8,wow... i guess try to tell her you have things under control. but it sounds like there is more to it if she is that worried about it. so either she knows every minute of your day or you are going to have more contact with the detectives. hard to tell you what you should do. sounds like  you have a major issue in your life going and then a complication to add to it. but good luck... i guess always remember... your day is always just seconds away from getting worse... so be happy with what you have. at least your mom loves you.... like i said... it could always be worse
8,Get back at him by sleeping with me.\n\nbut first dump his lieing cheating ass.  Fuckin lieing snake...
8,"If you have a problem with opening up to people face to face, the easiest way is to write him a letter or get him a card that has something very basic on the front. Like it might say, I like you.....and then inside write how you feel, but that you don't want it to ruin your friendship....then leave the ball in his court. If he doesn't seem interested or feel the same, then it wasn't meant to be. But I would definitely do it, because you never know unless you try!"
8,well..i'm a girl and if i'm interested to a guy...i always look at him and smile. Most girls I noticed..they play with their hair..cross their legs..always find a way just to talk to that guy and stay close beside him. Actually..you could feel it especially by looking directly to her eyes!!
8,"you can babysit and bath me anytime ,you stunner"
8,Get a FUWKING life!  Stop watching people.
8,"Her parents are racist dear. You can't change that.\n\nIf you were older, I would say ignore it, they will get over it. Sadly, you are too young to drive and you don't have your own life set up away from everything as to give them an example of how you aren't all these stereotypes and these horrible racist things they keep talking about.\n\nOh, cussing out the daddy wasn't the best of moves by the by.\n\nI would release myself from the relationship. Tell her you think her parents are racist and mean and you don't want to deal with that. Tell her that if she talks to them and she thinks she can change their minds about their behavior, you will resume the relationship...otherwise move on. \n\nHer parents are horrible. I am sorry for that, but they are big in her life right now and no matter how great she is...she cant escape them. Maybe later on in life you two can get together, if you still feel that way later on."
8,take time when you get there and get to know them
8,in short u just remember one thing tat the movie is bout discovery of intimacy by a couple held up at the island
8,"Depends are you looking for one? Or are you waiting for her to come to you? I believe in the luck of the Irish, she is out there try to find her."
8,"yes I have and many people have done it to me. It's cool to ""accidentally touch them cause you are dying to ""really"" touch them. I use to do it all the time with someone I love and he did it with me too cause we were too afraid to fess up that we were crazy about each other."
8,don't EVER get urself involved with dis kinda girls again.they're bad 4 you.not worth ur time.\nUR BETTER OFF WITHOUT HER.\n4GET BOUT HER.\nIGNORE HER.
8,"It should be good, if the friend of the crush is an okay person.  If they're not, then it might not work out so well in getting together with the crush.\n\nBest to keep crushes to yourself, or to the person you're crushing on.  Having other people know can put them in a tremendous position of power, which often isn't good."
8,TO FIGHT FOR CUSTODY IS HARD THE JUDGE ALWAYS SIDES WITH THE MOTHER UNLESS U HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE.

8,When your friend lets you hang around with her and bf it's not right to try to entice him from her.Btetter stick with your own bf as you'll get a bad name if your other friends can't trust you
8,"It's true men are more visually stimulated and women are more emotionally stimulated.  They are not mutually exclusive, men and women just have diffferent preferences."
8,"I suggest go for something romatic. Like a poem showing how you feel about her. I know it may sound really soppy, but girls love that sort of thing. Show your feelings, and she'll appreciate it immensly, I am sure."
8,Any way I can get it
8,"ok, so i lost you there at the end, but... there is always someone who gets all weird & acts distant to the family. they usually have other issues & i really suggest just staying out of it all & avoid such drama. making a fuss is only going to piss the brother off instead of making him WANT to be around the family. you can't assume it is only the woman who wants to keep him to herself. unless he says that. there may be much more to the situation than what you realize. so, i would just enjoy the family you have & accept your brother for the decisions he chooses to make."
8,"The way I see it, your best friend is the only one that is going to get really hurt.  Because your sister's ex is just talking to her to get your sister mad.  Your sister already made a decision and he is using your friend to make his.  Tell her to chill for a bit and see how things develop, just in case his ""confused"" like all men claim they are when they don't want to admit they f*cked up.  Good luck to all"
8,Have you ever heard of a chat room?
8,"Meeting people over the Internet isn't the safest thing to do...Its not safe AT ALL. But if you do want to meet someone than just go join a group on Yahoo! When you meet someone NEVER give out personal information,unless you now them and trust them. Don't tell them your real age. They might change theirs to make them sound younger/older so that they could talk to you.\nBe careful!"
8,I moved away over 1100 miles to get him to see I don't want him anymore. I had an order of protection and he got it removed cause like you he had people in the system to remove it. I stated a new life and my daughter lives with him and he still wants and loves me over 7 years later but living happily with new husband and as they say out of site out of mind....
8,"Ugh. \nSteven Valverde, 7th grade, summer.\nTechnically, I made out with a guy in preschool, but that hardly counts, now does it? =]"
8,"Um, no, it is NOT RIGHT! What is wrong with you people? He is MARRIED! That means he stood before God and vowed to be faithful and honest to this woman. And, instead, he is out trolling for God knows what on the internet. Yuk. Find your own man, this one is taken. Plus, why would you want a creep llike that?"
8,"You should feel special and irreplaceable, but it will take some time, are you sure you want to stay with him, ask your self is me and my b/f headed down that marriage path? if the answer is no, than why are you with him? your wasting your time, if the answer is yes, get some counseling together, and work things out, fight for your relationship (not the girls he was txt'ing) but work hard, and it will blossom, it will take some time, are you willing to put in that time?"
8,as long as she knows you're stronger than her just believe in your self and go and tell it to her you must show her (when talking)that you love her and you're ready to do anything for her.good luck
8,I believe it is 250 and 604.  Hope that helps.
8,It is how you live your life I have bi fantasies among many other kinds of fantasies.I am 64 and never have had a experience with another man.So I would say in reality it is how you live.I will agree you can become a prisoner of your mind but again in reality it is what you do.So I am straight.The reality is if I acted out the fantasy i would hate it.I do know who I am .I also know how my fantasies hold me prisoner yet for me fantasies are exciting .In reality if I was truly offered a threesome or another man I would more in likely not do it.
8,IT DEPENDS ON THE WOMAN CARRYING THEM.
8,"Sounds like you need to take a hard look at yourself.  It does sound like maybe you are judgmental.  How you can say a movie is stupid after admitting that you haven't even seen it?  Isn't that a good example of being judgmental?  \n\nIt is normal to react to criticism with hurt and denial.  But, take a deep breath, calm down and really think about your behavior and comments.  You could also ask others who are close to you how they feel.  But, do that only if you are willing to hear the truth no matter how painful it is.  Often, we are not aware of how our words and actions come across to others.  \n\nCriticism is usually meant to help us improve ourselves so instead of taking it personally, really think it through."
8,not if you live in Georgia
8,"Damn I know how you feel I am going threw the same thing just flirt with him and let him know you like him and then if he likes you he will make a move but you have to let him know its ok to make a move, like go see a movie or something like that and put your hand on the arm rest (after you have flirted) and maybe he will take your hand just something simple don't push it."
8,"are u arguing about a dude,,,,and if so i hope its not chamillionare"
8,"It always happens, but try to keep it to a minimum.\nTry not to expand your thughts or details about that time in your life.\nThis gives the impression that you are still thinking about your previous lover, and that there may be some baggage there."
8,if your asking that ? maybe u shouldnt get married

8,"No - they don't work.  The time spent waiting for surveys would be better spent taking your resume to every darn business in town, putting on a good attitude, and asking for a job."
8,"depends on how you feel about living with him, and if you are ready to make that big leap in him knowing every thing you do.. i lived with a boyfriend for a while and it sucked.."
8,"If you mean a crush on a girl next door,I have but nothing has ever happened since women don't care about the nice guy."
8,it just means ur not ready to settle down yet.
8,"Yo, I'm from here..."
8,"nooo :) many women pretend to like it. so i'm just honest. but, also have to say, it depends on the man - smile."
8,because as men we fantisize alot. a hot sexy nurse just feeds our fire
8,i dont....i just want sex
8,Your smile - a lot of times when you first make eye contact she will scope out your face & if you've got a really great smile that will go a long way towards hooking your interest. Get your teeth whitened & keep them that way. Use chapstick so your lips will appear smooth & soft. Practice smiling in a mirror so you get it exactly right - you want it to go all the way to your eyes. Smile at her as if she's the only woman on the face of the planet . . . \nGood luck!
8,too bad for her...that is very self centered.make clear that your mum has a place in your heart as well.
8,go outside!! it's a lot better to find a gf/bf when you actually MEET!! good luck!
8,when i was 20 i dated a woman who was 32. well we didnt really date all she wanted to do was hook up with no commitment. im not really that kind of guy but it was the best sex id haver had. we were both free to try whatever we wanted with eachother. we called it quits about 4 months in because we started have feelings for eachother.
8,"Guys tend to express lack of interest by avoiding time together, not being as intimate with you, and being unclear about any future plans.\n\nIf he is a decent guy, I think you should be able to get a direct response to the question ""is there something wrong lately?  I feel like you are being a bit distant"".  List the reasons you think so, and ask whether you are being ridiculous or not.\n\nI suggest doing that soon, rather than waiting and analizing everything he does.  You will drive yourself nuts, and likely cause the relationship to end on a bad note as your angry/fear/worry all get bottled up until they explode (usually not in a positive way).\n\nI hope it works out for you.  Talk to him.  If you can't do that, it's not a relationship anyway."
8,"I am currently engaged to a Hatian American (born in Haiti rasied here)he speaks both english,french and creaole perfectly. I very much want our kids to speak creole and french as part of their heritage thats what its all about heritage if your siblings dont feel its important that there choice but as a mother take pride and teach your kids the language and history of your country it's something to be proud of not enough people feel that way so make your decision with that in mind."
8,"Aren't you laying it on a little thick? It's apparent that you do read,but do you have to quote everything so badly? Try useing your own words and you might make more sense. It sounds like your trying to impress yourself more than anyone else."
8,"Dude, you are a senior, its time you realize no one picks your friends but you. You hang out with who you want, it doesn't matter... you won't see half or more of them after this year anyways."
8,"My 22 yr old and my 14 yr old were 12 once, my 11 yr old will be 12 in 3 months and my 3 yr old and 11 month old have a long way to go before I need to worry. My boy, I had no problems with, really involved in sport. Not that I had probs with my daughter but so many ""girly things"" made it a little more challenging. But I love them all and wouldn't trade a single one of them even though the last four are ALL GIRLS!!!!!!!!AAAAAHHHHHHGGGGG"
8,"During the ""teen"" years, the neurons and electrons in the brain are experimenting with logic paths. This routing and rerouting takes from 3 to 5 years for the average individual. The know it all phase, is one that allows for freedom of speech, and empowerment, if it were to be stifled, it only comes back in the form of anger later in life. My recommendation is to grin and bear all the abnormalities, and just sit back and enjoy the show!!!\n\nHuggs and Kisses,,,\n\nLonnie"
8,"Honestly, there's a lot, I'm kind of picky. But I like women who can smile and joke and not take everything too seriously, but who know what to be serious about."
8,"I would say we always look for a girl that looks good in our eyes and is approved by our influencing friends and family..........also she has to be cool, in her own world....like, have people that look up to her, dress nice, and then ....most importantly ( a girl that the guy can trust in, a girl that he can say to himself....she wont mess around on me...)  Also very important is good for the girl to like the guy alot and show it, but dont go' crazy over us........unless U feel safe that we feel the same way....."
8,"if you really feel like you need to lose weight for his FRIENDS, go ahead. dressing differently will make you cooler, but you will not be yourself anymore. but do whatever floats your boat. if you want my opinion, dont change anything. you sound like a really sweet girl and if he is stupid enough not to see you for you, then the best thing might be to move on and just forget about him. i know its cliche, and you didnt want to hear it, but you might have to. ask him what is wrong and if he is a true friend, he will tell you. and if he really does love you, then he will come back to you, unless he is a complete moron who only goes for the sluts. try ignoring him for a while, and see how he reacts to you. \n\n\ngood luck!!"
8,Eat more chocolate.
8,"How about a bad break up story? \n\nI was waiting for my b/f to bring me my boom box to teach a dance class. He was supposed to be there by 8pm. We waited and waited for him. At 2am when the place closed, I walked out with my students and friends to find a note on my car. He said that he had waited for me but since I didn't come out (like I was supposed to know he was outside!), he had to leave a note. What it came down to was that he was a coward and couldn't break up face to face and in front of my friends. \n\nAnyway, after telling me that afternoon that he loved me, he told me in the note that it wasn't working out........what a loser! I am better off without him!"
8,He is scared. Or he must be lieing to you. Don't listen to him watch his actions
8,"No, of course it doesn't make him gay (as the first two answers cover)...\n\nBut what's a ""Real MAN"" anyway? And how does someone ""look gay""? Aren't gay men real men?"
8,Flirt with them.  If they smile at you and it's not a fake smile then they probably do.
8,"If you love him, yes. But why did you guys break up in the first place? Did he cheat on you or vise versa? Did he lie to you or vise versa? Do you guys trust each other? Really think about these things. Then decide from there."
8,"Not always....But, what would life be without some drama?!"
8,"Show him that you appreciate him in the little ways! A hug in the morning. A kiss goodnight. A note somewhere he wouldn't expect it. Talk to him, let him know that you're there and you're interested! And when the right time comes, you'll go to the next level, I'm sure of it! You sound like your relationship has great potential. Go for it! Good luck!!!"
8,Omgoodness you totally just described me. Haha Im exactly the same [[somewhat in between shy and outgoin]] Soo I really wouldnt give you such great advice. Haha except be yourself. Laugh. Smile & Keep Awesome eye contact..and phisically Hug. Play with his hand..joke around..push him..you know all that crazy fun loving stuff =] But either way i think he noticed ur a little shy already but hes still talkin to you. That jsut proves he likes you ...
8,Right this is hard to answer but i had the same problem. First of all dont go over the top and follow her around girls hate it. ALWAYS be you if you dont and you do get with her and your somone different it will change things and you might lose her. If you smoke STOP girls hate lads with horrible breath. ask her and a couple of her friends to go to the pictures or somwhere public at first to see if she likes you it is also its good idea to take some of your friends to. Ask her out when the time comes. it is best to do this when no one is with her and you as this will make you feel intimidated and wont help you. where a bit of aftershave but not overpowering. and make sure you look nice. dont crowd her to much as girls like their personal space. just be yourself and take it slow. If you need anymore help email me at callum_collins@yahoo.co.uk Hope it all goes ok.
8,I'm not going to say yes or no due to the fact that it shouldn't matter....You said you like yourself for who you are....That is a sexier attribute than reducing yourself to a category...The funny guy or the serious guy....
8,Trust me if you don't feel it it's not there. Go with your gut. you'll know when you've hit the jackpot. You can't force yourself to be into someone trust me I've tried and it never works.
8,"Hey, in actual fact, thats a good thing! Because girls that are slightly chubby are really cuddly and nice to hug =D"
8,Kick is butt to the curb.  It isn't much of a relationship if he is lying and making you look bad on purpose.  If a boyfriend doesn't respect you then he is just a boy and not your friend at all.
8,"To the mall, to a movie, to a park, to a zoo, mini golf, ten pin bowling, local swimming pool, fishing?\n\nEven just out for a sundae or a milkshake to get to know each other better.\n\nWear something you know you look good in and feel comfortable in.  Don't go for the sexy look, you won't need it, he will be glad enough just to have your company."
8,"Be confidant (or just act like you are, same thing)."
8,i do e-mail me at  lilhotiemex@yahoo.com
8,"I think he just wouldn't feel right and he isn't completely sure of...both of you... because obviously it didn't work out the first time.My advice is give him some more time.Make him believe,and I mean really believe,you guys can work out!I would feel bad if you guys didn't get back together because you didn't prove to him anything."
8,"First I was single and sometimes lonely.  Then I was married but not bored, even though he could be very boring!  I kept my life active.  Although we were both satisfied with our marriage, it did end 9 yrs later.  When I found myself single again, I decided not to be lonely or bored.  I got online and dated a lot.  Had an absolute blast!!!  Then I stumbled upon Mr. Right and we're still having fun.  The two options you gave are not the only ones to choose from - in this life, YOU get to create your reality every day.  If you didn't like yesterday, tomorrow can be different.  I like the old axiom: if nothing changes, then nothing changes."
8,"Your profile picture is good. It's beautiful, tasteful and classy. Hope he enjoys!"
8,"It all depends on whether or not your comfortable having a long-distance relationship. if you chose the guy who lives further away, you'd have to deal with seeing the other guy all the time."
8,No.It all sounds like a pretty normal relationship to me.Just get another key cut!So next time he goes to get locked you can lock!
8,"If divorce is eminent it is usually because a women has found someone else.  Fighting for your marriage may seem like the right path but a lot of times it just isn't going to work.  Try giving her some space to think it over and you should do the same.  If a marriage is really going to work it will work and marriage counseling will not make it better, it will just put a band aid on a gaping wound.  Sometimes it is better to let go and move on then dwell and be unhappy."
8,"Every feeling or emotion we have is not driven by the significant woman in our life.\nWe can get upset because of something outside a relationship.\n""It's not you, it's me"" actually applies here. lol"
8,The stairs leading up to my bedroom and/or the garage.
8,Well then...\n\n\n\nSmack him upside the head!!!!\n\n\n\nHope that helped!!!
8,"I had hinted big time that I wanted an asscher cut diamond....but later I realized that I wanted a round one instead, but I never said anything to him.  BUT he ended up getting me a round one anyways!!  I love it!  He must be psychic"
8,"it depends o nthe boy , what he feels about that girl ,and his character ,"
8,Why do you ask that what happend?
8,"there are many descent guys out there, you just have to find them. Good Luck"
8,"first of all how close are you with this guy and ur friend?if you feel like it aint right tell your friend to stop fooling around with other guys when he aint around that way, she might try to change ( that is if she wants to ) then if things dont change tell  her you dont think what she's doin is right.\nif you tell  her ur gonna tell the dude she'll think u wanna get him all to ur self so talk to ur galfriend and try help her sort herself first"
8,Didnt you ever hear of blue balls? Yes it hurts as they swell to build up. It is a physical mandatory for men to release pressure as it slowly poisons the prostrate.
8,Because you talked about your entire day already. You need some time apart to have something to talk about.
8,"Good question, 'love' is such an umbrella term for the whole gamut of human attraction feelings. I guess the only way you know you love someone is if you put them first before yourself all the time. Personally I think this is a crazy idea, which is why I won't fall in love, nor will I lie to someone either. I think people need to be more honest and not say things that their partner wants them to say but they don't feel. Love is what you make of it, everyone has their own set of rules for it. To ask others what it is, is like saying what is the definition of chocolate flavoured ice cream? You can bet it tastes different every place you have it. Chocolate is a good substitute for love anyway, so eat that!"
8,"as long as you both feel as winners ,yes its good!but marriage is all built on how much you try to be a winner and also make him to feel same!for me,although it was tough as we have too many differences,specially different cultures,it was very good!we fight,get sad,love,respect,share,laugh and ... looking at same thing and seeing differences is not matter but careing about similarities is the secret of a good marriage!"
8,"If you love your boyfriend then how can you love another?Sounds like to me that you have not figured out what real love is.Also does he tell you that he cares for you just to hit the booty?Remember that men love to have more than one on the side.And if he cares for you so much,why is he still with his girl?"
8,ALL LIES! Da Vinci Code is all lies!
8,To be true to there vow's..
8,"I hate New Year too Aimee as I am sure a lot of people do. We won't be doing anything special either, I normally go into a chat room if I am really down at least you can have a few giggles there."
8,"Bubblegum,\n\nI attended an interesting presentation on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome, back in March.  I learned that scientists used to thing that they had similar causes, because the medication for Parkinson's helped a lot of patients with restless leg syndrome.  However, now they think that the two diseases have less in common.  \n\nAfter the presentation, I blogged on it at :  http://myparkinsonsinfo.com/index.php?p=169\n\nMy advice is to start keeping a journal of your symptoms.  Just a few words every day about what is happening.  Take that journal into your next appointment with your neurologist (preferably one who is even more specialized in movement disorders).  She or he will try to match therapies and medications with your symptoms.  It is imporatant to go for a match for you, rather than  what you see on TV, or whatever they ""typically prescribe.""  Good luck.  Email me if you have more questions.  Thanks!"
8,cause anything u can do men can do better ..;)\n\nand we can beat things up ....grrrrrrr aint men good
8,"the secret is having a great time, laughin and all that good stuff."
8,Ben is a HUGE mamas boy and his mama LOVES Jen soooo yea it will last a while plus he is a new daddy now!  I would much rather see him with her than that skank Lopez!  He is an all american HOTTIE and he deserves a clean cut- sweet girl like Jen Garner!  He is a hottie I give u that much but i feel the same way about Kurt Russell he should be MINE not Goldie Hawns!!!!  But we can still have them in our dreams!
8,"in this day and age where 60% of all marriages end in divorce, a pre nup should be mandatory, keep in mind what the state sees a marriage as, not a loving union, but as a merger of 2 individual corporations, hence why you need a license, when you divorce, one party sues the other  for dissolution of the marriage ( merger ) and thus assests come into play.\n\n Love has NOTHING to do with money and assests, a common misconception of women. Marriage is a business deal, nothing more, you need to be professional about it. Like any business deal restrictive and unfair pre nups are thrown out and null and void, so be careful about the language and make sure it fair and proper, have them both signed in presence of his / her attorneys, do not use 1 attorney for the prenups as many court will view this as cohersion and signing under intimidation / duress.\n\nOnce you view the marriage as such be prepared for resistance from the bride to be, if she does not sign, do not marry. It's akin to going into a business venture where you do not know what the rules are much less the consequences, only to have the partner rip the business of and later found out a simple contract could have protected you. The main reason women will not like to sing saying it's unromantic ( remind them of how a state sees the marriage ), if that the case draw up a simple paper, throw a ceremony, and you are spritually married ( the stae will not recognized it however ), women want the license sans prenup becuase they know in the event of divorce they will get 50% of community assests ( and with a good lawyer ) more, hence why you should pretect you hard earned assests. Prenup cannot void things such as alimony, child support, nor child custody, as those are matters of Family court where raw emotion often work against the male going in.\n\nIdeally I would tell you to NEVER marry, as I like to use this simple example, if you knew 2 out of 3 flights on take off or landing would crash killing all passengers and crew, would you fly ?\nHave a long time GF if you want, have kid with her if you feel the need to, but NEVER NEVER get married, there is simply nothing in it for you."
8,"Well this could be the one,I am with my soul mate and it was just something different about her that made me introduce myself,and we have been together nearly a year now,so take the plunge and ask him out,it may be destiny calling,or you could just be 2 ships passing in the night"
8,"If by lover you are including treating you right and what not, a genuine country guy cannot be beat."
8,Watch a very scary movie together and make the most out of the situation... if you got what i mean
8,"You are too young for this kind of things, Why dont you wait until you are ready for marriage."
8,"A touchy subject to bring up with the new missus, indeed.  You'd certainly kick yourself though if you ended up needing one and didn't have it.  This type of thing is best handled through your lawyer, let him be considered the ""bad guy"", tell your spouse it was his idea."
8,You havnt even got back together and already there are questions and drama. It's already a preview for more things to happen. Take this into consideration
8,Forgive and trust and again.  Not everyone is like that.  Some people simply do not have a concept of loyalty and faithfulness.
8,she's behind you!
8,"Relax, it won't be easy but there are good guys out there who are interested in dating a woman like you.  When I was single, I had no problem with dating a woman who had kids.  The key is to be picky and always put your kids first.  Unfortunately there are a lot of bad people out there who will try to prey on you and your kids so don't put up with any crap and don't settle for anyone less than what your looking for."
8,"if I see you every damm day and and you like me so god damm much, why not just ask me out? I'll never know you liked me otherwise! cuz, watching from afar ain't going to get you anywhere!"
8,Mentally NO!  Financially YES!  I max out my 401K & have maxed out my Roth IRA every year!  Not to mention life insurance!  Did I mention I have been doing this since I was 22?
8,I'm planning my eventual world (and lunar) domination.
8,"it is not what will we lose, it is what will we get or find there!\njust think\nI believe in God"
8,Because you haven't gone out with me!
8,Lots of lube
8,"This turban guys is a walking time bomb, no pun intended.  He can't be trusted.  My wife used to work with one and he did the same thing.  He would even go outside for lunch and feed alkaselzor to the pidgeons and when they'd die he'd kick them and say ""F***ing infidel birds!""  Don't trust this guy.  I'd give him a good old fashioned ass kicking just to let him know you're not going to sit back and watch him stink the place up and intimidate everyone.\n\nGood Luck!"
8,you feel better when you are with her than when you are without her.\n\nyou care more about her than you do about yourself.\n\nyou would do anything to make her happy and safe.\n\nimagine your life without her in it. if that makes you feel sick in your stomach. guess shes the one!!!
8,Talk to her because you a jealous that some body did that to her and you did not. But she is not with that person now is she(for what ever reason)  and it is more about you trying to prove yourself than about you giving her pleasure
8,"Depends on the perspective you are looking from.\n\nFor a male gay, a man would be better.\n\nFo a hetero male a woman would be better and for a hetero female vice-versa.\n\nfor a lez, a woman would be better.\n\nThere are some things that women are better at then men, while the men are better at some.\n\nIt'd be about an even contest, except that ....ah forget it let me go and enjoy myself with my woman!..2 pts....he he he he he he\n\nst"
8,"If you are in a relationship with the person you want to tell, then tell that person straight up, ""I love you."" If not in relationship, then try, ""I love you, ya know that?"" It tells the person how ya feel but makes it lighthearted and non-commital. (also gives the other person an opportunity to tell you how they feel.)"
8,"NOPE AND WITH AN EXPLANATION LIKE THAT AND HIM LIVING SO FAR AWAY I SUGGEST YOU NOT PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET BECAUSE THERES A GOOD CHANCE YOUR NOT THE ONLY ONE HE'S SEEING 7, MOUTHS ISN'T VERY LONG IT TOOK ME A WHOLE YEAR TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT MY GUY AND STOP SEEING OTHER PEOPLE ON THE SIDE AND WE ONLY STAYED 5 MINUTES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER."
8,"No blame necessary.  You clearly give her what she doesn't get at home, and if it hasn't interfered in their relationship...then hats off to both of you!"
8,i prefer hell
8,"Ask him to stop calling you. You guys need to move on and memories of each other are bringing both of you down. Just say, _______ please don't call me anymore, I'm ready to move on. IT sounds like your the girl when there's no one lese and you never want to be that. Don't sit in an unhealthy long distance relationship when you know things aren't goin to work out. Be the bigger person and stop the calls. If they don't stop, change your number because you need to move on and so does he."
8,"He loved you enough and he wishes that your love is enough for me. Enough means sleep together. Don't hope for more from him. Maybe he is a jerk, maybe he isn't but let the enough is enough."
8,"Talk to her a bit.  She seems to like you in some form, I'm not saying that she has a crush on you (though she might), but I would definitely say she at least wants to be friends with you.  If she laughing at your jokes, just strike up a conversation with her.  Then, if she starts flirting with you in other ways you'll know it is definitely a crush.  However, if she doesn't, then, she probably just shares your sense of humor."
8,"I have a Russian gf and she is beautiful, kind and intelligent.  I wouldn't change her for anything.\n\nAs a rule, Ruskies tend to look after themselves well and are not lazy.  Very feminine and like to be treated like a lady."
8,"Low probability of success if you go into things out of desperation. develop some new interest to take your mind off the cause of desperation, calm down and then have a look around you to identify likely candidates for your attention."
8,"Second is inside the panties without hand penetration & up the shirt.   third base is actually hand penetration (finger).  Some say 3rd is even oral sex without 'finishing'.   You should NOT ask to go to second.  When youre on first, stay there for a little longer than you would normally, then at the moment that you may pull away, slowly, gently, calmly, proceed to second, allowing enough time for the girl to stop you if she's not ready.  Dont make a big deal of it, just go to second, if you fumble, don't worry, try again, don't start getting nervous and NEVER EVER apologize for messing up, just laugh it off and proceed until you're at the mound -  then fondle, and caress her, as if she was a expensive figurine, don't squeeze and mangle her as if she's a stress reliever..."
8,Yes. Billing problems and sometimes reception. They don't seem to care much for customer service. I looked up other complaints about them online right before it was cancelled months ago. Just look it up online... TONS of complaints from people. It's amazing they are still in business.
8,"One of the problems you may encounter is that sometimes immigrants changed their names in the new country.  For example, in John Jake's book ""Homeland"" he tells the story of a German immigrant family to the US named 'Kronin', who upon arriving in the US changed their name to 'Crown'.  The name 'Delbrey' could have been made up.  I know a person who was of Hungarian ancestry, and I believe the original name may have been something like 'Fulke', after a divorce changed her name from Shaeffer to 'Folk'.  So you see the problems in trying to trace things like this can be overwhelming.  Unless you have some record of the family line going way back it could be a very difficult search indeed."
8,"Switch up positions and I mean often. Time it takes between switching will slow his motor down and maybe even yours but you got to becareful and watch how hard or fast he is pumping you make him go slow from the get go. Find that position that works best for you and not for him. Dont be afraid to go oral or even stroke the guy off while switching up those positions. The is also this toy that you can buy that will wrap around his testicles and penis that will make a man stay harder longer but you gotta keep him hard while your slapping this thing on him. Freaked me out first time I saw it I was like""What you wanna put that on my jewels oh hell nahhhh!"" But it was alright...works great when you have had to much to drink and just need alittle help keepin ""rocky"" in the fight. All in all switch em up is the key to success!"
8,"wow\nwell im 16.... i know there are constantly urges\nbut for guys it a different story\ncause we dont have to worry - most of the time about the consequences.\ntrust me 14 is too young a age\nwait until at least 17 or 18 hour be an evan better age\ni konw its hard..... this girl i really like talks to me about that kind of stuff - but we say we're kidding.....its too young a age\ngo to any parent and as them ""when was your first time""\nsome will rarley say 15 or 16 but most of them say early 20's late teens\n\ntrust me\nWAIT!!"
8,"you should tell him and ask him if he want's to still be your friend. You can say ""Hey you know I like you but it's just that I don't want to have a relationship with you. Maybe we can still be friends"""
8,"She'd probably say, ""Why, thank you, young man, it's been years since anyone did that.  Spank me again, would you?"""
8,Yes there good men out there!! Just keep being yourself and Mr. Rigth will find u. Enjoy yourself but be safe finding him!!!
8,"Of course! But, if it seems weird to you, ask yourself ""why?"" If you truly respect, admire, and are attracted to this ""28 year old man""--then why not go out with him and get to know each other better? You are 22 years old, the 6 year age difference is not a big deal at all once you are in your twenties and beyond. The hard part at this point isn't this age difference, but how compatible are you for each other, do your strengths compliment each others' weaknesses? Ask yourself this here and in any potential relationship: ""Do we share the same basic moral grounds? If we ""fall out"" in an argument, will we land in the same place even if we disagree on this issue?"" Age, at this point, is not so much an issue, but of how matured your life experiences have made you both, and how you interact with each other."
8,I love haveing my hair touched for some reason i enjoy it when a men runs his hands through my hair :-/
8,"Depends on if you believe or not. You can argue the point for as long as you would like, but it still comes down to one very important point do you believe."
8,"your son shouldn't be accepting because homosexuality is WRONG. i say u call off the engagement. maybe you can continue to date the guy but what the F. is the world coming to when we feel as though we are not correct in shunning things that are unnatural, blasphemous, and disgusting!!"
8,"i think thats a normal thing when you find yourself sad...especially after a break up.  Breaking up when you dont want to, is like suffering a loss, and with that loss comes the sadness of the ""what might have beens""...its like you are mourning the loss of a life that could have been, but now is gone all together...and thats normal.  Being tired can be simply a way of your body trying to cope with the emotional heart ache your mind is going through...remember, just because you are asleep, that doesnt mean your brain stops functioning...and its going all night long trying to process this loss and these emotions...with time you will be fine(yeah i know everyone says that, but it REALLY is the truth).  So good luck, maybe try getting a little more sleep...at least you are out there doing somthing instead of staying home and being completly miserable...give yourself a lot of credit for that...cause i didnt go anywhere for like a month after i broke up with my ex...and i slept all the time...so i feel you....."
8,"You could always make him a homemade colorful card, and then you could make a ""coupon"" saying that it is good for one free tickle when ever he wants it.LOL he should get a kick out of it, my cousin did."
8,"values, commitment, trustworthiness, association, interests, etc."
8,"Well he kinda does pay the bills and support your whole family and face it you wouldnt have those designer jeans on if he didnt drag his butt out of bed everymorning and go to work, i think your the spoiled kid in this situation, maybe you need to look at everything your dad does for you instead of everything you wish he would be. I bet he wishes he had a daughter that got better grades and didnt want to spend so much money on retarded things constantly but he got stuck with you..... sucks huh?"
8,tell her to do a naked handstand and eat her like a popsicle. \n\nmmmmm
8,"He is in the wrong in this situation. It is not your fault that your mom got in the middle of something an could not control her words. If he is mad at you for something as small as this then he is not worth it. Even if you do love him, he does not have the right to make you feel bad like this. just make sure that his cuz understands that it was not you. You also have to remember that you are a strong, beautiful woman and the he should be honored to even be friends with you! :)"
8,ANGELIA JOLIE I THINK THATS HOW YOU SPELL HER NAME. SHE GOT SOME SEXY A** LIPS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO FEEL AND A BODY I CAN CARESS ALL NIGHT LONG. OHHH YEAH AND ALICIA KEYS NOW SHE IS A FINE WOMAN RIGHT THERE
8,"I know a few times that I was going on a blind date with a guy I asked a friend to call me about an hour into the date so I had an out. So yes, it is possible that a call could be a sign that they thought the date was going badly and they wanted to get out of it. \nBut on the other hand, there have been times that I have gotten true emergency phone calls during dates, and I had to rush out. It only happened a couple of times, but it can happen. The only way you really will be able to tell is if you get a call later apologizing and asking for another date. Then you will know that there really was an emergency and it wasn't a set up."
8,you know what to do but afraid to take the first step because he might hurt you again physically... why not consult with a legal counsel and ask him the best way to get out with the relationship. you have to be strong to face the consequences that would save your life and pride as a person. Good luck ;-)
8,I would think it's ok but I would prefer to cherish that token of love. Besides there's too many stories of workers taking personal belongings left in the casket and the family never finding out. Save your keepsakes.
8,"kids entering adolescence or puberty age undergoes a psychosocial crisis- the ROLE IDENTITY VS CONFUSION state wherein they start to explore and try to know who they really are... you can see them mingling with same sex or most of the time the opposite sex... some individuals learn their identity at a very early age... but as we all know, there are exceptions... some would still be undecided at the age of 20 and above..."
8,"I think, stay friends for a while.  Just don't always hang around him and make some space between you guys.  If your other friends feel the same way, tell him, or just stop constantly hanging around with him, he should get the picture.    Sometimes, people'll change if you give it time."
8,"Truthfully, I think that if a person looks hard enough they can find sin in everything and everyone.  The interesting thing is that people who spend their lives looking for sin in others rarely, if ever, find sin within themselves.  Personally I find it important to remember these two things:\nFirst, man not God placed a rating on sin.  In the eyes of God the person who lies is just as much a sinner as the person who murders.  So, in that regard, have we not all sinned?\nSecond there are my two favorite verses from the bible:\nMatthew 7:1-5\nJudge not, that ye be not judged. \nFor with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. \nAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? \nOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \nThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.\nLuke 6:37-38\nJudge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: \nGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
8,"Well....get yourself all prettied up, because you are going to be in the paper now! \nWhy do people believe this stuff!!!! ha ha ;~0"
8,I do believe she wrote Black Lion...very good book.
8,god gave it to u.DO NOT GIVE IT BACK
8,Any husband that would say that to their wife should not be married.  Porn is an addiction just like anything else.  The both of you need to go to therapy together and fix this problem.  Verbal abuse is just as bad as the physical.  Don't let his problem get you down.  Either seek professional help to fix this or move on.  There is a man out there that will love you no matter what.  Those are the ones to hold on to.
8,"Your wedding vows stated it the best .Honor and cherish,forsaking all others to cleave only unto her from this day forward. What more could any parent want than for their child(ren) to be happy with the life they have made for themselves. It may not be the parents'choice but it is not their life. I think your parents should try to keep everything in perspective.Sit down with your parents and let them know you want them to be a part of your life. However you will not let them come between you and your husband.Let them know that you would like to build a home with doors that are open  not closed. It is their choice how the door works.Good luck."
8,"Be yourself.  If you pretend to be something you're not, you'll eventually resent that she doesn't ""know"" you.  Many, many relationships and even marriages, fail because the couple has not been who they really are.  \n\nIn order to get to know her, and find out if she wants to get to know you, start by finding out what her interests are and choosing something that you also find interesting.  Then start a conversation or ask her advice on that topic.  REALLY listen when she talks, and look her in the eye (not the chest!)  If it doesn't work out, then you're better of for having stayed true to yourself.\n\nAlso- if you don't want to ""be yourself"" because you think you're too flawed or a bad person, then you need to work on your self-confidence and learn to really love yourself before you even consider trying to get into a relationship.  Poor self esteem is at the root of ALL causes of failed relationships (think about it)."
8,"Just walk up to him and ask him, ""Yo"", ""I was wonder if you like me because I have a strong attraction towards you and I was wondering if you feel the same way about me?""\nThen you will find out the hard way but at least you'll find out right away.  The only way is to be blunt and that is the only way, got it?"
8,"No, make him go get tested.  If he isn't willing to do that, then you shouldn't be willing to give him anything."
8,"you need to contact the local police station where she came from and ask them...tell them you situation and ask if she has any criminal record...you can also go to the newspaper where she is from and ask if you can search the old papers...(I used to work for our local newspaper) They will give you access to the papers and you will have to do some research. It may take some time, but all newpapers should let you research old papers."
8,No... it is not nasty!!!!\nI love it when my man doing it for me
8,haha.. hmm.. no.. it' not wrong.. but sure sounds weird.. haha.. and if your cooking is that good.. i'd say that too?! & after I'd close my eyes and lick my lips & say mmm..mmm..mmm.. you taste sooo good!
8,"what men want is a woman who is open minded.  Don't get me wrong, looks are what will attract us at first, but its the same for you at first too, isn't it?"
8,what is more important you friendship or showing her you are good in bed
8,"You deserve much better than that, honey.  I know after 10 years it would be hard to leave, but that might be what you need to do.  One of two things could happen...you could possibly move on and find a much better life, or you husband would realize just how much he's lost after you are gone and come running back.  Either way, you should do something.  You can't just sit around and let your husband think that his actions aren't affecting you.\nGood luck with whatever you decide and stay strong!"
8,wait - he has your number.  you don't want to sound too desperate.
8,"After three years somebody needs to step up to the plate here. If he can't do it and you can't do it consider this. Have a good friend of yours, his or the both of you drop some subtle hints to him. That way it won't be like you said anything to him yourself. Make sure it's someone you can trust completely. Hopefully you can get your answer that way. Good Luck!"
8,are u dating ?
8,watch and take notes on what to do and what not to do. Also remember not to ever have sex where you caught them as that might get you caught.
8,"No, but you're entitled to your opinion!"
8,"Well, if a guys see's stretch marks and is disgusted.. then they are really shallow. Most girls have stretch marks, and they cant help it. Even really small girls get them."
8,take you time. when you find the right one it will happen naturally.... your young enjoy being a kid.. life is too quick.....
8,At 12 you know nothing about love.
8,"In the US, the last vestige of the dowry is the tradition that ther bride's family pay for the wedding.  \n\nOf course, that's dying off too, because girlies complain ""that's not fair""\n\nbut alimony is?"
8,"Everyone seeks affirmation.\nThink about your total relationship with this man? \nIs he trustworthy? \nIs he loyal?\nDoes he have integrity?\nIf he does maybe he was just at a party and having a good time and a chick did give him her number. And it is purely innocent.\nHe was flattered by the attention. But never would have acted on it and you can take him at his word that he just called to tell him he was married.\nBe flattered someone else found your man hot!!!!\n\nIf you two are having problems this may be wake up cal to fix the issues or the relationship will end. You know if there are problems or not. Don't be afraid to ask him how he feels. I put ""ask not confront"" because confront is the start of a confrontation, it doesn't sound like you are looking for a fight.\nIt never hurts to be aware of what's going on. If he starts acting differently, then you may need to take a more aggressive approach.\nIf he is trustworthy then trust him and his word, if he is not then start setting yourself up for a smooth exit...........\nMountains out of mole hills are not fights worth fighting!!!!!!"
8,"hey, romeo is here, be bold be smart man and ask that lingo. dont worry. if you want to knowmy own personal style that always work MAIL ME. remeber i am romeo , no one here is more experienced."
8,"I was 10.  She was a hottie.  I was on cloud 9 for a week, until I realized that she had started dating another guy."
8,"It's not just women who do that, men do as well. There are NO guarantees that she won't cheat again. The question is, do you want to take that chance? I always say, if they cheat once they'll do it again."
8,Stop trying to make them get along and don't hang out with them at the same time.\nThey probably don't like the idea of having to share you.
8,"This is from a guy. For all those guys for whom this is a big deal, I suggest you bring it up while dating, not after you become boyfriend/girlfriend. This way, guys, you can decide then & there if you want to pursue this relationship any further knowing you probably won't be getting what you so desire.\nWith that said, guys really need to spend more time in foreplay with their ladies.  Too often, the sex will become routine for the women as the guys are only worried about getting their own nut off, and thinking that the woman is alright because she's been faking it just to make the guys feel good about themselves."
8,I prefer motion. but if its too small then no matter the size of the ocean waves you had better compensate for the size.  I also must say that girth is much more important then length.
8,"It would be very difficult to buy something she will like, so money is the best gift.  She can put it to good use now, or save it for use at college.  In fact, a better gift might be a CD maturing in 6 to 18 months, in case she is like many teens who might tend to spend too fast."
8,what about this address?
8,You deserve devotion and caring from the father of your children. If he cant be a loving husband then you need to move on. You need to protect your child. \n\nGood Luck and God Bless!!
8,"I'm not Muslim..  But your husband has turned her down...in the past.  So he does not like, want or love her.  Her feelings are one sided.  yes she is jealous you have the man she wanted but didn't want her.  I agree with others she is no friend of yours.  If at all possible I would exclude her from your house and set her away for the lack of respect she has shown you and your family.  If you have to be near her than I would ignore her be polite but stay away from her...tell you husband about what she does that you know it's childish and petty but it's hurtful and maybe he can talk to her brother about it.  But I agree never leave her around him alone she is spiteful and is likely to start another rumor that won't be pleasant for anybody."
8,"She loves the power she has over you.  \nShe may also be going through some very difficult emotions right now and she dosn't know what she wants.  Give her what she needs, you'll not only help her out  but you'll also feel better about yourself.  Just don't get your feeling envolved.  \nGood Luck."

8,To compare makeup tips??\n\nYou attract THE hottest guys..\n\nHomework help\n\nall the above?
8,"Understand one thing, my friend: For alot of women, sex is more then physical. It's emotional as well. For us guys, it's mainly physical. That's what's happening.  She letting her emotions go. Don't make an issue out of it with her.  She may become self-conscious about it. Enjoy it! She obviously feels emotionally connected to you.\nI know I'll take some shots from some guys for this one, but the two of you are making love, not just having sex."
8,"Hey, what are you doing Friday?  I heard ..... is fun.  Want to go sometime?"
8,email me ;-)
8,"I prefer girls shorter than me, which works 'cause I'm 6'1"". It does help, when I've done something really stupid, that she has to look up to me. What can I say?"
8,"Yes, of course, as long as it's good for you and him who cares ...I would definitively date a girl that was taller than me (I actually have done so)"
8,yes it can be a sign of love.  Not wanting to go because u want to here each other voices is very sweet and romantic!:)
8,Move to a bigger town.
8,"Can't answer for all women, as 4 me I enjoy anal sex very much if approached in the pleasing manner, anal sex can't be hushed right into you have to massage or lick the clit first then input a finger or two into PUSS[Y] rubbing down to the asshole with quick flicks of the finger or tongue fingering first to relax the muscles once ready to insert shaft slowly in and out keep moving many men stuff it way inside and leave it movement keeps muscles flexing not stiffening around the shaft.""in a nut shell assholes need 4play"""
8,"hahaha..honestly this is so funny...okay..for whatever the reason is you cannot beat your woman..her power not even half yours..but i can understand in the minute she hits you, you cant think because of the pain and the normal reaction is to hit back, cuz it's all about reflects. but here's what you can do in time of phisycal fighting instead of beating her as a revenge, grab both of her arm so she cant move, and watch her legs cuz she will try to kick your hip and below. the safest position is hold her from the back, so that she cant move and you're not doing her any harm..."
8,"the chemistry we have with each other. it was something i never had with no one. the first day i met him was crazy. we talked on the phone for hours and hours and said so much. by the first week that we new each other we already had developed a crush. the way he makes me feel no one has ever done that. i feel so comfortable around him no matter what i say, do, or wear. he understands me and just the little things he does makes me know hes the one. even years later i still get goose bumps when he touches me or what he tells me :)"
8,sure if its only chatting
8,"All you gotta do is not be so shy.  Step up to him and say, ""Hi."" to break the ice and then go on from there."
8,"If he was cheating on his wife with you, what makes you think he's not going to cheat on you.  Unfortunately, the odds are he'll always be a cheater...why?  There will always be someone like yourself who will be there for him and accepts the situation then later try to change him. Then he'll just find someone else.  He won't change.  Don't you think you owe it to yourself to be with someone you can trust?  Move on... life's too short."
8,"If I could go back in time and relive some of the wonderful experiences I had, I would love to do that.  But I would not want to go back and changes things, so that they would in turn change how the future is.\n\nI would love to go back and relive the first time my son picked me flowers and the first time my daughter said I love you.\n\nBut I would not want to change them ~ just cherish the moments a little longer."
8,There are other ways of getting out of an unhappy marriage than to go and screw someone else. But if that's the kind of person that you want to be then go ahead.
8,cant help you but anyone one care to take a look at my playboy covergirls not its a cool site
8,and there is no question listed.
8,Are you serious? It looks like you have a heavy burden on your shoulders. Nobody hates their life so much without realizing they need help. What happened to you in your childhood?\nYou need help. Professional! Immediately!
8,"I will say that sometimes when a woman is missing some of that romance she at times can shut down sexually. The male at times can be so into his needs that he doesn't give the woman that tlc that they need. I think that maybe the situation here. Is he doing the things that make you feel loved, wanted, desired? Does he pay attention to you when you talk? You delimma is one of the mind and is translating into the physical. Do some inventory of what you are feeling, when it started, and what changed. This should pinpoint what the issues are.\n\nGood Luck"
8,"To to you the truth, It really depends on the guy. Being yourself is the best way to meet the ""right"" person for you, but if you're looking to get with this ONE guy who you aren't sure likes you,... first try putting yourself into his life subtly. Make small interuptions in his daily activity. DON'T make a fool of yourself or anything, just put yourself in a position to be noticed. after a little while, make an appearance for him, greet him politely and ask him to go with you for coffee or dinner some time. \n\nIf he doesn't go for that, I don't think it could go much further, but I think you should atleast get his attention."
8,"If she says yes and  doesn't like him, he will only be more hurt later. She shouldn't go out with him. However, even if he's a geek, he may be a really nice guy. Who knows. Give him a chance, with a friendship, and see if anything goes from there."
8,"Price doesn't matter.  You can find a beautiful ring for a reasonable price.  Just don't sacrifice quality.  My engagement ring is gorgeous and suits me to a tea, and my fiance only spent $2000 on it.  I know some women who's rings cost more.  I say just pick something out that says ""her"" all over, and you can't lose.  Or if you're really not sure - buy a single solitaire ring to use for the engagement, then go back with her and the two of you can pick something together.  Engraving?  I think it's nice, but not necessary."
8,"there alot of qualities, beauty is in the eye of the holder, good personallity, loyalty which goes with trust, fun to be with and do different activities, have the ability to complement the man and yet be her own person"
8,"In a bathroom. I'm such a s.l.u.t. LOL I was 15 and my best friend's brother and I were hanging out watching TV. Dragonball Z to be exact. He was also 15. All of a sudden, we started kissing and since there was no empty bedrooms available, we did it in the bathroom. Not the best time but we've laughed about it since."
8,"I don't think it a matter of Indian woman liking fair of white men. It's most likely that they (Indian woman) just looking for a relationship that will suit there family's wishes and also give a sense of independence. Due to arrange marriage's and so forth it seems like the fair or white guy is gonna be a bit more successful in his dealings and presents somewhat a comfort zone for Hopefully the Indian woman if not, then her family. Don't want to step on toes. This is just my thought which could uses some expansion upon this topic"
8,never forgive\n\nnever forget
8,"Maybe he is just shy that you wouldnt want to date him. OR he could be waiting for YOU to make the first move... You know, trying to play hard to get... But usually, guys wont do that, not that any I know anyway..."
8,Wow..that is a great poem..Did you write that?  Well I am in love with someone but unfortunately he doesn't love me back..so it is hard but I am getting over the pain..But when I do find love I will let you know how I feel..
8,"I think if you want to ask her out, you should first become more confident in your self. Girls can sense insecurity, and it's a total turn off. Then you need to just ask, like ""I was going to go to go see... on friday, wanna come?""\nthen at least you can play it off like you just wanted to chill, but if it works in your favor GREAT!!!!"
8,"when you and your partner are willing to do little things for each other (like doing the dishes, cooking, etc) without asking, and simply because you care for them - that is so imporant. if you are willing to go the extra step just to make them happy! that shows that you really care"
8,"i dont know who, but i bet he would have at least asked that question in a different category. or maybe he was having problems with his girlfriend. she cheated on him with his best friend who is a girl! but his best friend wanted to break them up cos she actually likes him. she wanted to prove that his girlfriend would cheat on him. well it worked, but now she has lost him cos he cant trust her. he is left alone and confused. so now he is so depressed cos his lost his girlfriend and best friend, he has purt another question up asking how to get over it. also how to kill himself. but then he realises he is a god, not that powerful but he should have all the answer. he finds his purpose in life is to answer others questions on here. the rest is history."
8,Run Away Run Away!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nJust remember jealous boyfriend syndrome- side effects may include you getting your face smashed in or damage to vital organs.
8,"umm drop the i god gift to the world act and get the hell over yourslef! maybe a guy that can show that just bc he is attractive he is still loving, nice and wont judge people and can hold thier own and will go out of thier way to make someone happy even if its not whate evryone else would do!"
8,realize that anyone can change for any given reason\n\nrealize that there is good in all of us if we will only let it shine\n\nrealize that life is too short to continue to waste time hating or berating\n\nrealize that you are blessed with all kinds of people in your life who only help you become stronger in some form\n\nrealize that God has a purpose for each of our lives\n\nrealize that you could gain a really good friend from a former bad enemy\n\nrealize but for the grace of God - there go I!
8,"the main problem with what you are talking about is all the STD'S! I mean if you want your penis to rot and fall off then by all means stick it where ever you wish, but most chicks hate ""playaz"" b/c they don't want to get a ""gift"" they can't get rid of"
8,"Not really, although sometimes I can't buy shirts that I want because I ALWAYS have to wear a bra.  It's all good though.  \n\nBotheration...I like that word LOL!"

8,"~~a safe and clean environment for them to play in, adiquate napping places, a budget, plans on what the parents are required to supply and what you will supply, and depending on how many children, and what ages you plan on taking in, you may need an assistant or more.  an emergency supply of diapers for those parents who forget to bring enough for their babies... a variety supply of extra clothes for emergency situations, depending on the age of the children, an activity plan, suitable and age appropriate music, videos, books and toys that can be easily cleaned, (especially when it is cold and flu season) if you are going to have outdoor activities it would be a good idea to have a fenced in yard, a written contract between you and the parents stating what you will supply and what they will supply, including your rates in the contract, and also including charges if you have to supply the emergency diapers (to cover your costs)... plan nutritious snacks, take it easy on the sugar content and salt content. -- another form you might consider is a medical concent form with the child's dr's name and phone number on it, with permission in an emergency situation to have the child transported to the nearest hospital, and also a list of each child's medical needs, meds, allergies, etc...~~"
8,"You broke up with this guy for a reason. Ask yourself if you really like your ex. Who do you want to be with? maybe you should just be single for a while and just date around. Maybe try to be friends with your ex and see how that works out for you, see if your feelings resurface, but also tell him to date as well. It'll all work out if you think things over."
8,"I am not sure, but do you mean, another culture? \n\nThe person will appreciate it a lot if you dont make them feel like they are ""different"" or make them feel left out. Show interest in their culture, and ask them questions about it. Like how long they have been in the country, where their family is etc. Just show ur curiosity basically.\n\nAlso, another nice thing would be that if you going out somewhere with your other friend (or even alone) ask the person to join you! They will truly appreciate you and will go home smiling."
8,If you know he's having an affair why don't you just confront him and get it out in the open.   Lack of communication is what leads to affairs and divorces in the first place.
8,"that is just plain mean, and has you to the point that you do not want to have any thing to do with him, next time tell him actions speak louder than word, and even louder than lies"
8,"His behavior changes, he may act happier (more chipper!) than normal, may bring you flowers for no reason (out of guilt, I guess) He could go the other way also and seem more distant. Spending more time away from home. Taking too long to go to the store. Working later than normal. Not wanting to have sex as often.\n\nIf the phone rings and hangs up when you answer, or rings once then stops and all of the sudden then he either has to leave to the store for a pack or cigs or a can of skoal or goes into a different room to make a private call. He also may hide in the bathroom. So if you think he is in there talking to himself.. he is NOT! If he is out with his guy friends he may go into the bathroom of the restaurant to call you instead of talking to you in front of his supposed guy friends.\n\nIf he dresses up to just do errands, puts on cologne. Spending more time in the bathroom. Buying brand new underwear is another sign, men usually wait until their underwear have holes and are falling apart before they will buy new ones.lol.\n\nAnother sign is wanting to take a shower immediately after coming home. Make sure you are awake and waiting for him at the door! Or if he is out late with the guys, he may take a shower before he wakes you. So smell him the first chance you get!!! They could also have unusual stains in their underwear, different pubic hairs may be stuck to the inside so check before washing. Check his car for different cigarette butts or anything that shouldn't be there."
8,"Hi,\n\nAs long as it takes....\n\nCheers!!"
8,I like Dark Hair on guys with Blue eyes.
8,"There are other children who have had this problem, maybe they can give you a good answer! As a rule one drug can lead to other drugs. you need some one to intervene, you will not be able to prevent the child from using, especially if child is not ready to receive help! There are drug induced mental illness. You may want to go to a meeting for parents of users, AA, alateen for kids, adult children of alcoholics and dysfunctional families. You can seek out facilities for these problems. Get a hold of \ndr. phil, he will have info on how to deal with this. wHATEVER, YOU NEED TO SEEK HELP FOR THIS CHILD ASAP BEFORE THE CHILD IS LOST FROM USING.\nGOODlUCK. Take Action, THERE IS HELP! kEEP ASKING FOR HELP TILL YOU FIND IT!"
8,She is retired for the time being she looks a hot mess right about now.  Probably due to those 70's and 80's drugs she was doing so that she make her movies.
8,when it is true its a wonderful feeling!
8,Are you an idiot. He asked you on a date. If you aren't sure ASK HIM ITS NOT HARD
8,"You love who you love.  If you think you are in love with her, see if she is into you and then go from there."
8,"yeah, what else are we gonna do, tell them how much we care about them and talk about emotions?  gimme a break.  it's easier to toss them a beer and call them a douchebag."
8,Tell him that you want to remain close and when he comes back you will take it from there. One day at a time.
8,i was 16y/o......yup had turned sweet 16 and never been kissed!...didn't make it the whole way though!  Ended up dating the guy all through hs....good memories but glad i didn't end up w/him.
8,"well my sister is married to a man i hate...he is a no good drunken ************* ************ ************** ************ ***************** **************, but i just keep my mouth shut because she wants to make it work.......so i would say just be there for her always and keep your opinions to yourself...that is what she and i do for eachother.....she don't tell me sh*t and i don't tell her sh*t...seems to work out just better this way!"
8,"Why would you do that? Is she taking up all his time? Are you jealous? Maybe you know something about her and you dont want your brother hurt. Whatever it is back off, its his life let him live it."
8,"Just let things ride for a while, and see how things go. \n\nHe could be the best thing that ever happened to you, but give him the chance to prove that first. \n\nI wouldn't trash him because of his beliefs, and if everything else seems OK, you can always convert him later. Just make sure he does not have a problem with your beliefs. \n\nIf things work out, you may be able to get him to accept your way of thinking. \n\nGood luck, you know what to do, and you know how to do it, \n\nDarryl S."
8,He likes you but does'nt want anyone to know... i'd say he'd keep his feeling inside him (he wont ask you out)\n\nim not tryin to be mean or anything its just that i do the same thing to someone in my class.. sorry if i offended u
8,When? Where? Now?  Here?  okay
8,"first off ""You Go!!! You Rock!!!"" it takes strength to stand up to peer pressure like that.  You will go far in this life!  I have never done cocaine, and don't plan on it either.  the high you would get from it isn't worth your freedom.  even if you never got arrested for doing the drug, you would still become a prisoner.  (and no drug is worth the high to become it's slave)  Keep it up! I think you made a very intelligent and wise decision!"
8,"Take your time...sometimes missing someone can be therapeutic as well as painful.  You don't say what happened between you two so I can't really elaborate.  However, when my ex and I broke up, it took me quite some time to get over him.  I can assure you that no matter how hard it may seem right now, all of the feelings that you are experiencing will eventually pass.  Also, kudos to you for not jumping into another relationship.  Until we completely heal from a breakup the only thing we can bring into another relationship is pain......."
8,"Cute jewelry or make-it-yourself jewelry (made by you, or a kit that she can make jewelry for herself.)"
8,"Oh Mate, find another. I have found I can stop loving frailly easily by thinking about the pain I have had in my ar*se for so long. \nLet's face it, if you have been arguing with her, etc, it isn't worth it for a piece of.... and toast in the morning, if she gives you either. \nUnless you are uglier than a hank of rope and softer than an over warm knob of butter, you can find a better bed mate. And one that won't ar*se you. \nSo, though you may think I a right foul git for saying it, move on. My mum would say ""women are like buses another will be along soon enough.' \nBesides, if she has moved out, has her own digs, she is not planning to come back. I really think it would be a waste of your time. Sorry to say it, but it is probably more likely that Spain will win the world cup, playing under water, with no snorkel than she coming back to your life or bed."
8,He's probably too scared that you'll reject him. Let him know how you feel and see what happens!
8,"Yes, it's wrong and if you continue in this relationship, you are a homewrecker. I'm sure you're a nice person but you need to find someone who has no baggage and can commit solely to you. You won't be happy in the long run otherwise. You deserve better."
8,"as the saying goes....""bros before hoes""!!  Just tell him that the tramp isn't worth it.  If it wouldn't have been with you it would have been with someone else.  Some girls just can't keep their legs closed.  Once they become that way they rarely change.......like grandma used to say ""you can't turn a ho into a housewife"""
8,"Oh, you sound adorable!  Yes, I think this is a confidence issue.  Number one:  do not start dating again right away.  Rebounds do not help self-esteem.  It just makes you dependent on a girl's attention for self-love.  What I do is focus on the love that's already in my life, from friends and family members.  I just try to go out and have fun.  Pretty soon, I realize I'm having fun without a romantic interest.  And then, I become braver in approaching people, because their rejection isn't such a big deal.  I can do fine without them.  And don't look at other women as potential dates.  Look at them as potential friends.  Eventually, you'll find one you want to date and who will help you out of your shell.  But good luck and don't worry about it too much.  This girl isn't worth your time or worry."
8,"ask him what his fantasy is..most of the time they want a threesome with another woman..if thats his fantasy, then you're straight(no pun intended)"
8,"guys figure different sexual positions enhances the potential for a woman to get an orgasm.  let him try, who knows maybe ull find a comfortable position he puts u in, that u will like compared to the regular missionary.  kama sutra is a book w/ diff sexual positions, u both should look at it and see what may interest u both"
8,"First off... I am so very sorry for the loss of your daughter.  We lost our seven year old daughter, Rachel, to leukemia six years ago this month.  The loss of a child is a very, very heavy burden.\n\nTo me, the concept of a legacy can be boiled down to the word, ""gift.""  What gifts did your daughter have?  I believe that each of us has gifts inside us that are meant to be shared with others... painting, singing, dancing, cooking, laughter, service to others, gardening, parenting, fixing cars, smiles, carpentry, care-giving... We all have inner gifts that are shared outwardly with others.  What gifts did your daughter have?  How did she share them?  How did her gifts touch others?  How did they touch you?\n\nWere there special clothes (hats, shoes, jewelry) that set her apart... made her special... things she enjoyed wearing?  THese are symbols as important to you and your family as religious symbols are to believers.  What physical legacies did your daughter have?  Along this same line, did she have treasured possessions that were passed onto others (friends, family or even strangers)?  \n\nDid she win awards or special notice for things she did in her life?  Did she excell at sports or have hobbies?\n\nTheses are just a few ideas.\n\nMy own opinion here... I think in the end life boils down to two questions: How much did you love?... and, How much were you loved?  The fact that you are struggling with writing a legacy for your daughter and wanting to pass down her story to your other children and grandchildren says a whole lot about the love you feel for her.  There must be one heckuva story there.\n\nMy hope and prayer for you is peace.  Your grief is so very fresh and I'll bet it still cuts into your heart like a knife.  I wish you peace.\n\nMake notes about your daughter's life and try piecing them together.  Ask friends and family to help if you feel comfortable doing this and they feel comfortable helping you.\n\nMy best thoughts and prayers go with you on your journey"
8,"Who knows what this guy is after, some 27 year olds are for real and some are just out to get some..... i am 26 and know both types of guys. I say give him a chance and then go with your gut. You never know, he could turn out to be the ONE!"
8,"Sounds like a con to me - would you give your phone number to a complete stranger, and then answer personal questions ?"
8,"if you feel your value lies in your pocket pal that probably explains why you can't find a descent lady. they really don't care that much and finding out that you think your dick is so great would just be a total turn off. sorry that you can't see anything good about yourself except that, you are in for a sorry life. trust me NOBODY will ever think that thing is as great as you do!"
8,"Get a popup blocker at walmart or get a free one at download.com \nIve never been able to stop ALL popups.  \nDO clean your drive.

8,"USA, hands down. Women marrying for money, screwing for promotions, fcking the gardner for orgasms"
8,"If he is having problems with her now, when she is only sixteen then it will only get worse. The poor girl seems very insecure and he should discuss this with her but with such an age gap it is inevitable that someone will get hurt. This girl is too young and immature to be in a serious relationship, and I presume that he is looking for a serious relationship. The best advice I can give is for them to break up and for her to get help. Best of luck to your friend"
8,first of all how far along are u and have you told your parents?If so the first thing you need to do is keep your cool if you stress you could lose the baby then u need to work on eating habits try to eat healthier and i wouldn't try to have sex unless it's approved by  your doctor okay
8,"I am not sure what kegal exercises are, but when my best friend had a baby, the nurse told her that exercising her bladder muscles may help to tone her vaginal muscles (if she was worried about losing muscle tone in her vagina from giving birth. This is like when you are urinating, and you use the muscles to stop the flow of urine, but you can do these exercises without anyone realizing what you are doing. Do them when you are sitting at your desk, or when you are riding along in the car or even when you are standing too! Exercising your bladder muscles in this way just clinch then release and repeat, can help you some with your ""vaginal grip"", and I do know that by doing these exercises you can learn to do this gripping thing with your vaginal muscles that will enhance both yours and your partner's bedroom experiences, after I used these exercises for about a year (and I never had a baby). I think my orgasms were stronger, and my husband was not able to ""control his own blast off when my interior muscles were stonger.  Doing these exercises will also help you if you suffer from bladder control issues, like when you cough real hard or laugh too hard or sneeze and it causes you to pee a little bit. If this is anything like kegal exercises then it does work!\n\nGood luck, and congratulations on your baby. \n\nI am still using the exercises because I figure that even if I never have a baby, I could still have the bladder issues when I grow older, so if I can tone it up and make it a routine to exercise (simple exercise too!) and help myself, then it's all good. ;) \n\nOh and by the way when my friend had her second baby, her new muscle tone helped her when it came time to PUSH, she said that the second baby was so much easier to deliver because she understood how her own body worked and could work to make the birthing easier!  I was her coach both times, and I know that she says this simple exercise has helped to keep the romance in her home even with a toddler and a new baby in the house!"
8,"depends on where you live, as to weather you have a place around you that sells toys. let the moment happen. don't force it. let it happen. and make sure it is a great and real experience for the two of you. because once you do you can never take it back."
8,"Communication is the key element in all relationships. Talk to him in a non-attacking manner and tone. Start all sentences with ""I feel"". That always helps. The second he feels attacked, he will tune you out. That way he can only respond to how you feel and not what he may or may not be doing in your eyes. Good luck."
8,kindof a rattly statement just to say you like the guy.....\ngive it some time and if meant to be will work out!
8,you should tell him maybe he feels the same way too. I told my guy friend i liked him and now i am marreid with twins on the way. you never know unless you tell him who knows maybe he is your destiny and keeping this from him can change your faith.
8,"He has to learn to hear no. You shouldn't feel that it's your fault he made an attempt to kill himself. Try talking to him and explain that it's not that you don't love him. Explain why you said no. If he doesn't exept that, you don't want to marry him."
8,"Yes, I would say 6 inches is pretty average."
8,Gently tell her what you told us.  You should not be forced to do what you're not ready for.  It's not like you're ruling it out - you're just not ready.
8,I dont know if you can sue them but any type of sex outside of your marriage is considered adultry.

8,"play hard to get and she'll like it and maybe leave him for you, if thets what u want"
8,Of course it is possible.  Guys tend to fear rejection.  If they are insecure and don't believe that a girl of your looks would go out with them then they would rather stay away then risk getting rejected.  Hopefully you will meet a guy who sees you for more than your looks and is secure enough in himself to not worry about you rejecting him.

8,"why are you afraid to tell her that you dont like her behavior? I was in your situation when I was in collage and this girl was always chasing me! she wanted to be where I was because i was with my handsome and popular friends all the time (what could i do if they were my classmates!) anyway, one day I was just not in the mood to deal with her and I said: you know what, you have very good qualities but IT BOTHERS ME that you are with me because you want to hang out with my friends. Soooo.... stop being so obvious and let me have fun with them!  so, she got my point. she never spoke to me again (and my friends were happy for that too). it was sad because after all she was a good girl but A REAL PAIN IN THE BUTT!"
8,a nice butt. i love a nice butt
8,"A friend is someone who will laugh with you at the stupidest things.\nSomeone who never puts you down. Someone who will always listen to you no matter how rediculous your problems are.

I don't get along with females all that well.. never have. I had a best friend for literally ten years. We no longer speak or see each other so I can't answer the question about forever. I have made maybe 2 actual friends in the passed 3 years, though. Two really good friends are better than 20 ""so-so"" friends. I have tons of memories and pictures with my childhood friends.. and still love most of them to death. Soo that's my idea!!"

8,"Respect your parents, they know best. YOu didnt mention how old you are...\nHe could bring dinner to your house and you 2 could watch a movie."
8,"If they are as close to you as you say they are then you would never lose them over marrying this girl. If so they are crappy parents at giving unconditional love and support as they should be. How old are you by the way? If you are young that could be a reason. Parents are usually almost always right about these kinds of things. You are a grown @$$ man though and they need to back off and let you live and learn. Fallow you gut feelings, not your heart. Your heart will ALWAYS get you into trouble!"
8,"Find a support group. Your close friends, family or your bestfriend. Do things for YOU to make you feel that you don't need him. \n\nI don't know what happened between you two, but what matters most is how to make yourself happy.\n\n If he left, then I don't think he saw the best in you to stay! You deserve better!"
8,"It's funny with girls.  Since it's virtually impossible to know everything about a girl in five minutes, those who you do ask out immediately come to one conclusion: you're asking them out based on physical appearance.  Girls simply don't want to go out with a guy who is shallow.  But here's the catch...most guys (and girls) are shallow anyway; some are just better at hiding their shallowness.\n\nMaybe it's not your philosophy to discuss the weather over tea, but if you make more small-talk with the girl you intend to ask out (insert flirting accordingly), then you probably won't get rebuffed so brutally.\n\nIf the girl still rejects you, then she's either very shy or a snob.  Don't sweat it.  Move on.  But just here to tell you...five minutes ain't going to cut it."
8,"Hello Adri ----\n\nYeah, you seem 2 be in your teens or early twenties.\n\nListen, .....don't pay attention to all the ladies here telling you that men are trash and are no good.....they say that because that's the kind of guy that they've dated before and went through the same stuff as you are going through right now. \n\nEveryone in their life receives a ""Broken Heart""......and it's like graduating. Someone showed you that life is not all roses, my dear. ....however , do not think that ALL Boys or Men are slime....because we are not the same. \n\nThis ""guy"" that dumped you for no apparent reason did not truly appreciate you as a person......maybe he looked at you for what you had and not for the person that you are. \n\nPlease do not be bitter......but look at this as a learning experience, not as a disappointment. If you were the best girlfriend that you could be.....that's all that can be expected of you....is to try your best, young one. \n\nMen and Women can be so negative towards each other because we let emotions and feeling get in the way. However, we fail to look at ourselves and realize how lucky and unique we are as individuals. \n\nBe the beautiful person that you've always been....and never, ever let anyone break your spirit, ok ?? \n\nPeace and Harmony 2 U    :-D \n\nSincero."
8,A lot of people say that. I say it all the time. When I say it it usually means I'm confused and I need some time to think. Well if he's keeping you a secret maybe he's not man enough to admit that he likes you or something. If his friend has a crush on you and he wants to take a break maybe he doesn't want his friend to find out about you two.

8,"Both have redeeming qualities, number one is that they are women!!\nDepends on the lady!"
8,"its very simple now in days you see sex all over the place on TV, music, just talking to friends its everywhere and people are saying ""its ok as long as you are ready for it"" so young people gets this ideal ok when im ready i can have sex. then the question comes when am i ready? and when they ask this question they get their answer form the tv and the music and their friends and they answer it by say “when you are in love”. so they get this funny feeling inside and they think its love so now they are  in love and they are ready. BUT THAT’S NOT IT your ready when your ready to commit the rest of you life to that person and that person feel the same and then you two make that commit by getting marry and once that happens you are truly ready. So yeah young peopel have premarital sex b/c they are being lie to"
8,"I don't judge a girl on the way she looks, yeah looks are all apart of it but it's her personality that would draw me closer, not only her personality but the way she acts....looks aren't everything! I don't see a guy can like a girl only on her looks, it's never gonna last. Yeah sure she's hot but who cares if the relationship is only going to last a month, that's a month you could've been with someone that really counts."
8,"Get up the courage. Tell her you like her and if she would like to go out some time. Then take her some place nice where you can talk, not to the movies. Good luck."
8,"No, and yes. Until you're 18 years old, not a day before, they own you. They are held responsible by the law for every retarded move you make, and because of this, they have to know where you are, and what retarded moves you're making at all times. Once your stupidity won't land them in jail, when you're 18, you're free to do what you want. Until then, sorry, there's no curve like when you're in school, close is not good enough. 18 years to the day."
8,"From my personal experience, if you and your spouse have joint custody, then the custodial parent has to have permission from the non-custodial, in writing (through your attorneys) and visitation privileges changed since the children will be living out of state.  The non-custodial needs to make sure he is getting quality and ample visitation time as the agreement will be binding 18 yrs. and would surely have a profound effect of the children if the changes are not fair.  If you do have joint custody, then you do have the right to fight the move and a judge will make the decision based on each case.  Again, my experience tells me that it is very hard for the custodial to pull up stakes and just leave without the blessing of the non-custodial.  If full custody was given to one parent, then they do have the right to go wherever they want, but you can get the visitation agreement changed so that the children spend ample time with both parents.  Good Luck!"

8,"You should really think about your town as in graveyards, forests, parks. Is there a flatland where you can see the stars. Go get throw blanket and picknic basket pack a nice romantic meal and then go there and talk listen to each other and your dreams watch the stars.Have fun doesn't require sex. Go swing on a swing set. It is all there small towns are very fun. You don't need money, here's another idea get a book and read it to each other. All these things are very romantic,and sex free."
8,women dress for women that's probably why they look like clones cos when women go clubbing they eye each other up (competition)and the same for men

8,And what species would you be?
8,that's so cute. you should confront him and tell him how you feel.  you shouldn't run away from him in the halls.
8,Maybe you guys need space. I went through the same problem. Me and boyfriend lived apart for about 4 months to get space. And now we lived back together. Your not really depressed just unsure. Take this time to see why this happen. And how could you make a change.
8,"Sweetheart Ive got one thing to say. TOO MUCH DRAMA!!! If you dont trust him, dump him and move on."
8,"Well Red Bear, I'm the type that if it is going to bother me, I usually confront that person, or if I'm bored and have nothing to do, then I will confront that person because if someone is talking about me behind my back then that means they don't have the balls to do it to my face and it's fun to watch them squirm. So no, it doesn't irritate me. It gives me something to do when I get bored. I'm a straight forward kind of person and have been known to be bitchy, but I usually won't take any mess from anyone. If you are supposed to be my friend and are talking crap, then we are definitely going to talk about it and if you ain't my friend, then we are going to talk about it just because I know it will scare you. Their fear and anger excites me."
8,"be straight forward, honest, and tell her straight away, yet round about as well\n\nlook, i think your nice and have a nice (insert vocabulary, or sense of humor, or something of the like) but (insert annoying part) is annoying as hell, and i would appreciate it if you would cut it out/stop it"
8,"Yep, definitely typical teenager.  Sorry to tell you, but you are.  Your parents love you.  I know it doesn't seem that way now.  We all go through exactly what you're going through.  Trust me, if your parents didn't love you, they wouldn't care at all about what you do.  You may hate school, but you will never get anywhere if you don't go.  You'll always have a dead-end job.  You'll be struggling from paycheck to paycheck and not be able to take care of a family.  I know you're young and know everything, but in a couple of years you will realize you know nothing and you should have listened to your parents.  My parents were strict, too, and now I appreciate it.  More than you can imagine.  My friends who had parents that let them do whatever ended up in trouble and have horrible lives now.  I realize now that my parents were right.  And now I'm raising my 2 small children the same way.  I'm 24 and wish I could take back all the things I did to my mom when I thought she was being to strict.  I snuck around and did things she didn't approve of.  You don't realize it now, but you'll regret it.  I promise.  However, on the good side of things, at least you're going through this now.  Every single person has to go through this stage in some form or another.  If they don't do it in their teenage years, they'll do it as an adult.  And that can result in horrible problems.  I have a friend going through that now and it's awful.  I know you're angry with your parents and I know it sucks, but you'll appreciate it one day.  Just please realize that your parents do love you.  They care enough to worry about you.  Be grateful you don't have parents who don't give a crap what happens to you.  You are a lucky kid.  I know you probably don't care a bit what I say, but at least think about it.  Don't take advice from other people your age....they're going through it just as you are.  Take advice from people who have already been through it.  If not from me, then from someone you know who's older and been there done that.  Stop trashing your parents....they are the only ones you have.  And will ever have.  imagine your life without them....honestly, and not with the anger...."
8,"I'M IN A SIMILAR SITUATION LIKE THAT. ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS IS A MALE AND HE EXPRESSED HIS FEELINGS FOR ME AND I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER AS FRIENDS. WE ARE STILL AS CLOSE AS WE EVER WERE. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD FEAR LOSING HER AS A FRIEND BECAUSE IF YOU ALL ARE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS, YOU EXPRESSING YOUR FEELINGS TO HER SHOULD NOT CHANGE WHAT YOU TWO HAVE. I BELIEVE EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT FOR THE BEST AND YOU SHOULD JUST GO FOR IT. GOOD LUCK..."
8,"Always leaving the toilet sear down, pantyhose/tights and panties hanging all over the bathroom, manufactures a row so as we don't need to have sex. Won't have sex on the London Underground. Always pushes me on the damp patch."
8,"You are very strong for asking this question. You are certainly not asking for too much. This is not a problem she has with you, but a problem she has with commitment. She, for some reason, is not prepared to be as selfless and giving in a relationship as you have been with her. Maybe something is going on with her that is , creating this distance between the two of you. All though you probably already have, I suggest that you confront her and ask if their is an outside issue. If there is an outside issue and you help her through it, then you're relationship will be sstronger than ever. Best of luck to you!"
8,"Sure you can, it happens to be my nickname. LOL"
8,"I don't feel there is any useful information to give you.  I try not to be a horn dog.  But, that only lasts so long.  I am an older man too.  I try to take relationships seriously. But, always at the back of my mind (well, not always -- some women I am not in the least attracted to)... mostly I am a horn dog; but, I am really nice too.\nI have had some really pretty girl friends; but, I think I like a girl who gets along with me better -- or I get along with her.  I am still a horn dog; but, I can enjoy her company and I feel pretty much the same pride as guys who have gf who are just for show.  Maybe it's my standards are low.  I know that dating a real pretty girl or beautiful that other guys give you some kind of admiration.  But, I would be embarrassed about a girl's looks rather than go with a pretty girl I didn't like.  \nI want to know if there are things that you would share with a man that you aren't saying here that even if he is not bedding you he will value outside of how pretty you are.\nFinally I don't know if I should be saying any of this to you.  I mean, I think there is a code or rule that guys can't say things like this to pretty girls.  Sorry. I just have no idea of what to say to you.\n\nI like to read the other comments and then add something if I feel it needs it.  I think the answer with the zen in it is worthwhile.  And, I knew a girl who uglied up just to advoid worthless guys.  She did really well with that because that was just weird."
8,"She might be using you to make her man jealous - or, she might just be planning to use you to cheat on her man, while she keeps right on dating him. Yes, she is playing you!"
8,"flirt, of course,  heres some ways how to:\n\n1.charm her\n2.eye contact, look deep into her eyes\n3.smile when she looks at you\n4.compliment her!\n5.ask her for help at something shes really good at\n6.brush past her everytime you see her(it gets you noticed, and if you do it enough, she'll be like,cool what if he likes me)\n7.ask for her opinion on things(you'll let her be heard, and it shows you care about what she thinks)\n8.tilt your head slightly when she talks to you, (because it will show her your really interested in what shes saying)\n9.if you sit by her somewhere and she folds her arms, or puts her legs up, gradually do the same (mimicry is the greatest form of flattery)\n10.write lil notes to her pretending your bored or something, get her to write back, then you two can have your own secret little conversations, and doesnt every girl like getting a lil note once in a while? you can even probably tell if she really likes you or not dpending on if she writes back and how.\n \nthere, hope that helps!!!"
8,"Every woman likes a bit of adventure, surprise, suspense and grit.Sometimes the ones that provide all these are the 'dicks'. The 'gentlemen' are so busy trying to be nice that cease to be spontaneous and become boring. Women like a bit of that spontaneity."
8,"If the guy asks you out on a date, as in, not ""friends"" but a real live date, he is making the invitation to take you out and treat you. That is the understanding. If you ask him out, then it should be you who pays, since you would be the one planning the date. If the outing is more casual, like just coffee, and he doesn't offer to pay when he asks you to hang out, order your biscotti to go: because he just wants to be friends, or is totally clueless and not boyfriend material."

8,I say experience it all.  You won't know if you enjoy it if you don't try it.
8,"ouch. sorry but it sound slike you have been lied to and played. that boy is having his cake and eating it too. he is screwing both of you over and probably making up different stories to tell both of you. you should find a way to call her and ask her. but i would definitely confront him, but he will probably tell you more lies. it sure sounds like he is with both of you, why else would he have made something up to tell her instead of just telling her it was over? and why does he spend time with her and go places with her and call her??? that is just crap!"
8,"Honey, this girl will get you into trouble, it sounds like this girl wants you for her own!! my advice steer clear!  I have had a similar situation with a Friend of mine, she had a girl that hung around her like a bad smell, and she hated me, she treated my Friend like a minion and called her one!  I must admit she was a bitch 2!!  I think you might just need to sit this girl down and talk to her, perhaps she doesn't realize that her behavior is just a little OTT. The jealousy thing tho, this is harder to resume, but you have to ask yourself, why does she do that?? could she be insecure?  my feeling on this one from reading your little statement is that she is making you unhappy and that is wrong, why should she ruin your life, you are spending time thinking about her and your other Friend, there are times when being a little selfish, taking a step back and saying- 'whoa' this is not about 'me'...is good, do something for you, personally if she is as nagging and annoying as she sounds, you need to click your fingers to the left, click your fingers to the right and click your fingers to the left, (practice this now) its cool!!! and say to this girl- I don't need this drama' and walk away, because when push comes to shove all that matters is you! xxx"
8,"talk to a counsellor.\nthis is very unhealthy for both of you.\nshe 's never cheated you and why this bothers you...\ninsecurity...\ndon't let this garbage be back in your house..or you would keep on cleaning it..talk to her and share your feelings..\nbeing in marriage is being one..if one hurts, the other is hurt too... ask for forgiveness and give time with each other."
8,Leave her alone. If she is engaged already back off! First reason is called respect...don't try to steal a woman that is in a committed relationship. 2nd reason is that she loves this person she is going to marry and if you try to break that up you may make her upset or mad. This is not good if she is a coworker. You may cause relations between you to at work to be unpleasant and she may report you to hunman resources at the office. I am sure your employer would not like to hear that you are harrassing her (she could say) and trying to break up her potential marriage/engagement. 3rd reason is that you do not know what her fiance is really like. Her fiance may kick your A** if he finds out that you are trying to steal her away.

My parents were married at 19, and they love each other very much. My grandparents are the same way.

8,cant comprehend your question
8,"Sometomes when we give up something we're used to having around, it's rough. Your ex was a habit to you, and although you may never be in love with him again, you are wanting another relationship, or at least someone else to love. Plus you probably still really like him (as a person), and you're confusing that for love, when really you're just sorting your feelings out right now."
8,"Well maybe your step dad is doing a lot of things your real dad dosent do. Also, if you spend more time with your step dad then thats probably part of it. Think of it this way, atleast you like our step dad. Some people really dislike their parent(like me). So the fact that you love your Dad and step dad is something really good. Just stay optimistic."

8,"Don't let it go that far, that fast. ""It's easy"" as my Dad used to say & he was right. It's like wearing revealing clothes. Don't sell yourself short, Honey. If the guy wants it, you need to make him work for it. If he's worth the time, he'll work for it. If he's not-he won't. Pretty easy. Also a really quick test to find out if he's really interested in you, or just a quick time. Either way, it's really good knowledge to have."

8,"Your question is very vague. Even if you gave ALL the details and we had access to the files in the case, we still couldn't answer it any more than if we were shaking a Magic 8 Ball or reading Tarrot Cards.\n\nThe fact is, there are three people who have the best idea of his chances, the deffense attorney, the prosicuting attorney, and the judge. Your man probably doesn't even know very much himself.\n\nNo matter how good the evidence is, one way or the other, it depends on how it's interpreted by the judge and jury before a judgment can be entered.\n\nHe won't know until the judge hits the gavel with his final judgment.\n\nGood luck."
8,HEHEHHEEHEEEEEEEE is it a standard protocol or a Govt policy that you wanna be so sure!
8,"My suggestion is to contact him through your teacher.  In today's society, though shameful as it is, you better to protect yourself and --if you respect this young man, protect him too.  Your teacher gives you and the student teacher accountability so people cannot come back on you or him as if you were having an inappropriate relationship.  I am sure your intentions are honest and innocent (they better be or you shouldn't bother), but in our world you have to cover yourself.  Young men and women have lost their jobs by writing letters or having 'questionable' contact with students.\n\nI do think your student teacher would truly love to hear that he has done a great job and your educational experience and success was bolstered because of him...leave the whole 'crush' thing out though...that might be weird for him...or he might be a closet psycopath looking for a target...it's anyones guess in our world."
8,He has already been through one failed marriage and most marriages fail because of lack of communication. Your best bet is to just talk to him about it. Tell him how you feel. And once you get through this keep talking to him about your feelings and never stop.
8,Judge not by what he says but by how he behaves towards you.  Actions speak louder than words.
8,i did...but thats the worst mistake u can make...
8,"I think when she's feeling the same way, she'll reveal where she is.. relationships need to be mutual hun, and just because you are feeling this way, doesn't automatically mean she is.  And just because you are feeling this way, doesn't give you the 'right to track her down'.  Patience hun, if it's meant to be, she'll come around and tell you where she is!  Too many wierdo's on the net to just 'give up the info' to everyone you meet.  :)"
8,"There is a perspective that I've adopted that allows me to put things in focus. Look at it this way; negativity exists to define the good and vice versa. \n\nThat reminds me of a ""Six Feet Under"" preview. In it, one of the characters asks, ""Why do people have to die""? The other character responds, ""To make life have worth"". \n\nTo say that God allows some thing like rape, suggests that you have insight into how God works. Many people may feel, ""as you believe, so it shall be"". However, not one person on the planet could give you a confirmation on God and God's intentions. It's left to each individual's interpretation and belief.\n\nI understand where you are coming from, though. You're thinking, 'If God is so powerful, why doesn't God intervene'? I don't have a difinitve answer for that. But think of it this way; if God intervened all the time, how would any one learn any thing? \n\nOf course, it's not as if we're learning much as it is. However, most of us know better. We make our own decisions and whether we know it or not, our decisions affect every one around us.\n\nPeople get raped but also, some thing good happens. Not necessarily some thing equally and oppisite, though. However, down the line things will balance out.\n\nLife is full of in justices. You must know that, every thing moves in cycles and as the old saying goes, ""what goes around, comes around"". A rapist may not be punished today but one day his sins will be punished."
8,"It will only make things weird if he doesn't feel the same way after you've told him.  Do you think he could feel the same way? You need to find out whether you ask him upfront or ask his friends or mutual friends.  You need to find out first.  If he feels the same way, then I don't think there's anything wrong with giving it a try.  The best boyfriends are usually your friends first! The only downfall is if it doesn't work out (and it ends badly) it may not go back the way it used to be.  You need to decide if that's what you want and if he feels that way too."
8,"I just glanced at that site and it looked really scary like that program from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  I went through a horrible breakup (5 years) and I was really lost.  When We first broke up I asked a friend who was dumped by his girlfriend of 5 years for advice and he said that it just sucks, its going to suck for a while and then one day I will wake up and it won't suck as much.  He was totally right.  \nOne thing that did happen to me was that I had a freak out and realized I needed to get rid of all those comprimizes in my personality that I made for my Ex.  I got out old clothes I wore before I dated him, read all my old favorite books, listened to the music and watched the movies that influenced me before I met him.  I became more myself and less the 1/2 ""we"" ""us"" person I was.  I do keep those memories though, you should want to as well, there are good ones and the bad ones remind you of what not to do.\nI suggest watching What the Bleep Do We Know.  It talks about negative thought patterns and the main character has just experienced a break up.  It shows how that trauma can take over your mind and body (kind of like what that web site says) but that you can reclaim your life and retrain yourself not to be so devastated.  \nLive through your sadness, it will make you stronger and your future relationships stronger.  Don't dwell in your sadness, that will take over your life.  Take time to grieve for your lost relationship, allow yourself to be sad and angry allow yourself to love and hate your ex.  That is what is supposed to happen."

8,White chicks will definitely put away your laundry for you -- Do you prefer your laundry shoved down your throat or up your @$$?
8,"Of course. We are only human too, just like you guys. But sshhhh, don't let it get out, OK?"
8,"You could just ask him to stop. If its something like shaking his leg, he may just do it without realizing it. Its funny because my boyfriend does that do. I just put my hand on his knee and he stops. Eventually he starts up again, though. I think its because he has a hard time sitting still without doing something or haveing some kind of movement. He does it a lot when we are at the movies.  \nThe best thing to do is just talk to him about it. If its a small, silly thing like that, he will probably try to stop.\nOr, you can just try your best to ignore it. Try to focus on something else when he starts up with something like that\nAbout the heavy breathing, he may not be able to fix that. Does he have asthma or some other condition?"
8,Most that know my wife and I have no idea that we have been swingers for years.  The reason why most do not know is because of the closed-mindedness of most.

8,Of course.  We are all human and bad things happen!
8,"Because the girl is insecure, my guess.  I can't really totally explain it more than that.  But she should realize that it's actually a sign of him getting more comfortable with her.  See he's realizing that his life has been out of balance becuase he's been persuing her, and is now trying to balance things out.  This is a subconsious attempt to make a workable relationship that will last. and she should realize that.\n-Duo"
8,"From reading your description, it's sooo obvious that he likes you. I mean, why else would he hold your hand or rub your leg while at the movies. And hang out with you? If he doesn't like you, why would he wanna spend 5 hours talking on the phone to you? So YES, HE LIKES YOU. Now, if you like him back, just tell him that you like him and i'm sure he'll say that he'll like you back. :)"

I would go out with someone like you but would want you to letme know whenever you feel insecure with me. That would, by itself, slowly get you feel secure and then move easily with me."

8,"Easy! \n\nDoes he call you?\nDoes he want you around?\nDoes he make plans with you?\n\nYes, he wants to date.\n\nDoes he tell you to call him?\nDoes he want you around only when he can hang?\nDoes he tell you about his plans but does not include you in them?\n\nSorry, just friends.\n\nTake it from someone that has: been there, done that.  Move on! You need someone that is genuinely interested in your time and will make time for you no matter what."
8,Well I reckon that would that would be up to the gorilla since they are 10 times my equal. I just hope she isn't a little kongish and finds me the boy of here dreams.
8,"aw yes i do think she likes you. she might be flirtiing with other guys in front of you, because she may not think YOU like HER. i think you should ask her out. if she pulls you aside or when your alone, (or you pull HER aside) and just smile and say something like, ""your very nice and beautiful, and i was wondering if you would like to be my girlfriend?"" or something like that. be sure to smile and look into her eyes. girls love that. if she rejects you (which she probably wont) just do a subtle smile, and be understanding, and stay her friend.\n\n\ngood luck! :]"
8,Because sometimes we just cant handle the truth
8,It's possible and absolutely natural too! You can also have fantasies that's dreams/imaginations of having sex with someone else than the one with whom you are enjoying during the course of active sex! They say fantassies add to better sex performance. Try it!
8,Looks aren't everything. She likes or loves you for the person you are. Be thankful for that. My boyfriend thinks the same way. I tell him all the time its because he's an amazing man and I love him.
8,give him dirty looks every now and then and ignore him
8,"no, if you can't tell him to his face that you love him then you actually don't love him. Loving someone means you have to feel comfortable around him. If he can't take you seriously, then he don't have alot of trust in you. Just try it and see what happens. Whatever you do, please don't write it"
8,The deciding factors on who gets child custody anywhere should always be who is the better parent. Who will make the child the number one priority. I don't believe it should necessarily always be the mother. Whoever the better parent and person it should have the kids. That's what's in the kids best interests.
8,Giftcard from her favorite store.
8,just suck her pussy
8,"Okay, lets get to the root of it.  All guys are sexually attracted visually, meaning that guys need only a glimpse to get aroused and think sex.  Unfortunately, most guys let that arousal control them.  when that happens men can only see women as sex objects.\n\nOn the other hand, men who are not controlled by lust are capable of seeing beauty in women that is far beyond sex.  All hope is not lost.\n\nOne last thing.  Personal victory over lust can only happen with help from someone far greater than themselves.  Jesus Christ is the answer."
8,What r ya talkin about I am the drunk uncle want a drink of my jack and coke
8,"Girl trust me I do the same thing, and ask myself the same question. I finally came to realize that I don't think we do it on porpose, sometimes it just happens that way. Maybe we are afraid of being happy, or maybe we grew up in a really strict family, and we are good girls, and opposites really do attract. It's kindof like we realize that we will never be bad girls, so jerky, bad boys are what attracts us. Sometimes for me it's fun to get my heart broken so that I can be sad. You will realize though girl that in the end it's not worth it. I regret turning down good guys for jerks, cuz in the end I always lose. And a lot of times the good guys are nerdy, because since they have no looks they have to treat girl good. Maybe we are just to picky. But trust me there are good looking guys that will treat you good. Just don't give up."
8,only do what you ae comfortable with
8,"There was a mediocre movie with this as the theme a few years back, starring Michael Keaton.\n\nThe point was that it was a bad idea."
8,"I am a twin, and as much as my sister hates me sometimes, we always make up. Hang in there, she'll forgive and forget. She'll need you to have her back someday, and hopefully you'll be there. stay strong. Twin  Power!!!"
8,Call the district court clerk in your county and ask them. they will have the correct answer for you. Good Luck !
8,keep up the good work....trust is EARNED\nshe must have been hurt REAL BAD b4...\ndon't EVER give her a reason to not trust you\nif she EVER catches you flirting with another gal...it'll take EVEN longer for her to trust you again...
8,if you are a girl we need pics....if you are a guy go away and get a life.
8,"I think you're a cutie, if she left you for your looks then she is way too shallow for you.  Find someone you will like you for what's on the inside and your good looks just come with the package."
8,"yeah, pretty much - not so much because i'm completely closed-minded (i might go out with a non-punk girl if i knew any) but basically because i've only had one girlfriend and she happens to be a punk rocker as well...  i know for me as well as her, it was important that we both liked the same music and had the same interests (so we could go to shows together or do whatever).  so, yeah, go for it if you wanna, but know that the guy might put a lot of importance on the music he listens to... if you're into punk but don't look punk i don't think he'll mind much (unless he's a jerk), but if you hate punk rock or something, don't expect much..."
8,"Don't do it!  If he and/or she wishes to meet the other then let them step up and do so, once you get involved it's going to be a headache.  You can support the relationship as a friend and not initiate the relationship as a third party."
8,I find the best guys when I am just out and about going about my day.  Be bold and ask a cute girl out at a book store or the grocery store.
8,No way to know if you don't ask!
8,o he's definitely interested but i would watch my back if i were u
8,yes i like to have it with teen girls too..mmmm they go off cos most are sweet and want to learn.. im happy to teach.

8,Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette is the best breakup cd ever
8,Talk to her ask her to be honest with u about ur friendship. Ask her why she sighs when u sit next to her. I remember when I started secondary school that my friends made new friends and I became a bit distant with them. They got with different groups of friends and same with me to. Just talk to her about it.
8,"yes i have, with a couple of my friends playing truth and dare, i'm not going to say what happend or what we did but i would only say that it was gay and dirty."
8,Why is it ewwwww. You people need to try things before you say ewwwwwwww. I'm married. Even before I was married I have been with women. It spices things up. Its far from ewww..
8,from which school or college?
8,Yes. Family is very important to me and we are very close.
8,"I think it depends on the couple. If they have certain things that they really enjoy doing together, 'their things' can be kind of romantic and personally enticing for a proposal. Your man doing something romantic, like including your favorite flower or meal because he remembered that you liked it would be very heartwarming."
8,"if your the honest type and have a good relationshiop tell your friend, if not hide it and hit the chick up  the real question is pussy or dick"
8,MMMM Cheeezzze I like cheese!What do I have to do??
8,"You know what?  Screw it.  Stay with him, marry him, and live your whole life unhappy."
8,"I went with my husband several times to strip clubs in an effort to try and fix some of our intimacy problems.  I even bought him a lap dance one time.  However, afterwards, it doesn't make me feel good or cool or sexy, even thought it might make him feel that way about  me.  How you feel about you is more important.  After a strip club, part of me really hates him for not wanting to just explore with me.  I keep trying to tell myself that I should just go with the flow.  That men look at women like women look at shoes...but it never seems to make me feel any better.  Before you go, remember that you can never erase that memory once it's there.  On the other hand, at least you know who your husband really is and what he really wants.  Yes, you'll be the coolest wife in the world (like me), but then soon his affection towards you over it becomes empty.  My girlfriend is so jealous that my husband is so affectionate with me...but his affection doesn't make me feel cared about by him anymore."
8,"I know guys who date (and marry) women with kids.\n\nStill, it's hard enough for a single man to marry a woman without kids, take on the responsibility of that relationship, and use his time and energy for her sake rather than his own. \n\n(Obviously, this is why some of these single women have kids and no husband -- the guy used her, then skedaddled when the pressure got to be too much.)\n\nFor a guy to take on a woman with kids is even more overwhelming. Not only does he have to be care for his wife, but there are many other concerns:\n\n1. He has to keep a steady job, to provide not only for his wife but for children. (He can no longer pick up and relocate easily, quit a job he dislikes without serious thinking ahead of time, etc.) That's scary, and a big commitment. \n\n2. He's expected to be a dad, but has NO experience with kids -- as opposed to the mother, who started out knowing nothing and learned with the kids as they got older. He's got to start cold, halfway through the process. That's intimidating.\n\n3. If the biological father is around, he now has to deal with HIM ... possible confrontations if his wife or kids are being harmed or not dealt with properly.\n\n4. Dating a married woman means you're not as flexible, have to always juggle the kids in order to go out, etc.\n\nConsidering a guy could start fresh with a childless woman and not have to worry about this stuff, it's no wonder many opt out for the easier situation. He wants to avoid as much pressure as possible, and he wants to create his OWN family when he finally gets around to it, rather than caring for one someone else created.\n\nI don't necessarily think these are ""good"" reasons, and I think a real man can overcome them for a woman he cares about and is attracted to, but they are some of the typical considerations for a guy who is dating a woman with kids."
8,"I lived in Porto for a while, yes the women are beautiful.  First, not knowing so much portuguese might be an asset, as I have found they are very interested in American men.  Though they may not admit it.  Go dancing, in the clubs, just dance with a girl !without! a man and if shes down you'll discover the meaning of ficar in no time.  No need for words at all.  Youll get her number for sure.  Another great way is to go to a gym, theres a great one downtown, but itll cost you like 90 rais a month.  Good luck man, oh, and here's something to wisper into her ear: ""Quer ficar comigo?"" thats how its done."
8,"a little here, yes i'll admit it. And im working on it, thank you!"
8,"Hello Myca. I couldn't help but pick out your question, for obvious reasons of course. Let me go straight into it. The quick answer is NO! (Not with a friend first!) YES! If you think the relationship can handle it with someone that ya'll can meet and get to know for that purpose. OK?? If you would like to know why then read the following.......\n First of all I commend you for stating that you don't desire a man in this, (I'll comment on that later). Second, you’re lucky to have a man that hasn't shoved the thought of this down your throat since you both met (even better since this incident). Anyway, ""Is it a good idea..?"" you ask. Well in this case it's one of those grey areas we all see every now and then. From experience and dealing in ""The Lifestyle"", as they say, I recommend that you and your husband start with an unknown. The reason for this is simply because should you both decide to go through with this if it turns awkward or it just wasn't good or it was!! See that way you hurt no one and you both get to figure if it's something ya'll would like to consider doing again. Now let me say this, please understand that men and women are totally built different mentally and emotionally. I'm not trying to drag this out or be your counselor but these are thing people should take into consideration before doing things that may destroy something that's perfect already. So make sure that you both have a very, very open discussion about the possibilities of (Jealousy, How you both feel before and after the act, Jealousy!, Can one of you stop if other is uncomfortable?, JEALOUSY!! and disease). I'll take it that you both are very wise and know your partner and your friend. So if you trust and KNOW them well enough to not warrant any foreseeable problems, then HEY! ENJOY!! But remember, the beginning is always Bliss, but look further down the road!!"
8,"a casual guy, who isn't afraid to have fun.\n(if you're honest, and a great sense of humour that helps too..)"
8,"Hey rocker chick, \n     Horse back riding as damn fun.  But cowboy riding? buck up and try to hold on longer than 8 seconds for every body's sake.\n    And the song has song great lyrics, by the way."
8,This guy doesnt sound like hes being considerate of you in ANY way at all. He is using you. A guy who cares for a girl shows consideration. A guy can say anything to a girl but what do his actions tell you? Those speak louder than words. He is making everything about him and nothing about you. Is that what you really want?
8,i guess it is... but why ?
8,"Love and Sex are totally different entity.\n\nLove is something which will last forever. Its a feeling. Related to heart. A dedicated, pleasant experience. There will be sometimes in Love relationship you will get lot of pain. But still you will hang on, because you love.\n\nSex is an action. Its a pleasure, and for Fun. Its what you think. Related to mind. A human body is programmed to have SEX. The purpose of a Man & Woman, and the whole human generation depends on this ecstatic, pleasure activity between two people. \n\nWhen you are denied of sex, you will not feel that bad. You can masturbate and sleep well.According to me,  the most sexiest organ in a human body is MIND. But when you are denied of love, you don't get sleep. \n\nSo Love is more powerful, and precious than SEX. You might get a chance to have intercourse with many, but if you didn't gain even a single person to truly love you, any case, then there is no point in Living."
8,"You are better off not having neither one of them in your life. Karma's a bitch and what goes around, comes around. To make your life easier for you so that you can move on, talk to your friend. Tell her how you really feel. She betrayed you by sleeping with your boyfriend. Your boyfriend betrayed you as well because he knew exactly what he was doing and he didn't even stop it. It will take some time to get past this, but give yourself a chance on focusing your healing process and continue doing what you're supposed to be doing. Things will get better and you will have a new friend and a boyfriend that will not betray you. You don't have to forgive your friend if you don't want to. It is up to you and you have to do what is best for you right now."
8,"When we are in love we are willing to look past things-this doesn't mean that it is necessarily going to be a good result.  We see hope for a better future, we wish for the best, and we are more likely to forgive.  Unfortunately for those who are emotionally and physically abused, their self esteem continues to deteriorate until there is barely anything left.  When someone feels this low it is hard for them to realize they deserve better-they need good friends to keep encouraging them to be brave and to walk away from the abuse.  They have to take control over their own lives and start building themselves back up again.  This is very common - My tip-don't let abuse get away on you-at the first sign walk away-every woman deserves better!"
8,Aim a bit lower. A Bulls sweat shirt or tee shirt maybe better and a promise to watch the games on TV?
8,"It sounds to me like a little boy asking for mommy's permission to be bad ... that way he has all the pleasure of playing with matches, but evades the responsibility.\n\nGuy's have this way of being real cowards about ending a relationship. Instead they push their wife ... and push and push and push until she is backed into a corner with no option BUT to say ""I've had it -- no more!"" and then ... they go around saying ""Well, SHE wanted a divorce."" Once again, a little boy evading responsiblity.\n\nIf you want to keep this marriage, get some counselling. He needs to hear an outsider tell him he's being a jerk and not just you. If you'd just as soon be free to find a man who will honor and cherish you, then call his bluff. Tell him no way is a third person joining you in your marriage bed and when is initiating that divorce and moving out?"
8,knock knock I am here...don't worry I won't need Viagra to stay hard longer than 4 hours...LOL\n\nInterstell....do you share or are you going to hold me hostage...\n\nBy the way..Pardon Moi...don't compare me to Superman...he just doesn't have the stamina (he gets too tired)...I am nocturnal and I can go all night....
8,"Congratulations on your strong spirit. You should know you've crossed a great distance to being an adult, and rightly so.\n\nI lost my dad when I was 14, and it was hard. Real hard. However, in your case, you have no one of your parents left to comfort you anymore. Just knowing that is your first step into being a real human. God is testing you, and He will make it up for you, if not in this life, well, that's why we believe in Him.\n\nNo one can say anything to make you feel better. Many will try though, but look around, what about the maimed victims of war who lost their entire families? What about millions of poor individuals who know someday they're going to die a slow death, and that day isn't far away? God is testing them as well, believe me, the only thing that can help you is faith, faith in God, and in yourself.\n\nBe strong, and know you are not alone. Focus on your studies, and every time your eyes fill with tears from memories, let it be. Strong men also cry. It only makes them stronger.\n\nRegards,"
8,"If you have honestly tried your best to fight your shyness with little , or no, success, you might need to go to the doctor, and be put on some medication for it. I, too, am shy, but I fight it every day, and ""make"" myself talk to people, and interact. Good Luck!!"
8,Only way to tell is how he treats you... \n\nIf you are in a group ask him which girl he likes in the group and how much.\n\nIf he is a good friend you should be able to ask him and not have any come back.\n\nIt work both ways if a man like you he ask you ques and will try not to let you know.\n\nIts part of the growing up game.
8,"Buy her a beautiful frame or plaque to show her diploma off.  Or you could take her out for a night of just plain fun, just to get away from the stress of finding a new job. Or depending on her degree, you may get something for her that pertains to what she will be doing, like a briefcase-for business, stethascope-nurse, etc.  congrats to your friend and good luck with your gift buying, your a good friend."
8,"story from the little box:-\n\nIt's meaningful....\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area. Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,\n\nStudent : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Could you please help me?\n\nTeacher : (Silent for few second, than he answered)\n\nWell, it's a pretty hard and easy question.\n\nStudent : (Thinking hard) Huh???\n\nTeacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.\n\nStudent : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).\n\nA few minutes later...\n\nStudent : I'm back.\n\nTeacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.\n\nStudent : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Because you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.\n\nTeacher : That's what happened in real life.\n\nWhat is the message of this story?\n\n* Grass - is people around you\n* Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you\n* Grass Field - is time\n* In looking for your soulmate, please don't always\ncompare and hope that there will be a better one. By\ndoing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember\n\n""Time Never Goes Back"".\n\nIt applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the morale is LOVE & grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time!"

8,i did 350 miles away. it was everything i wanted it to be.
8,"Some tips that have work for me:\n\nAgree on joint custody of the kids. That way, you both can decide over the children'f future together and both of you can be involved making importatnt decisions in your kids lives.\n\nBe generous on visitation. That way the kids can have a fair share of both parents.\n\nHave an agreement with your soon-to -be ex about NOT badmouthing the other when not present, That hurts the kids. Make that solemn promise that you will not talk bad about the other one during visitation.\n\nHave a conversation with the kids, Explain what is about to happen and how much you love them and how daddy an mommy still care about each other. \n\nWhen visitation comes, try to make the transition an easy as posssible. This NO time for arguments or sour faces.\n\nRemain in friendly terms.\n\nAlways allow your ex to talk on the phone with the kids. ALWAYS.\n\nSend father day/birthday cards sign by the kids.\n\n\nCIVIL is never using the kids to get back at one another. Good for you that you are willling to do this."
8,"You showed a lot of courage writing a love letter. So, it's clear that you have made your feelings known to her and, since she is still talking to you, you did not totally scare her off. All good things.\n\nBut you do say she already has a boyfriend, so you should respect that part of her life. Given the situation, talking to her and being her friend is a great way to find out if your feelings get stronger, weaker, or stay the same as you get to know her better.\n\nWhat do the two of you talk about already? I would stick to what you are comfortable with for a while. How did you get to know her in the first place? Talk about the stuff you have in common. Nothing too deep in the beginning. That can come later as the friendship grows. Talk about classes you have together. Ask about how her after-school activities are going if you know what they are. Is she a cheerleader? Head of the math club? A guitar player in a band? Ask her how the stuff she cares about is going. Or maybe you can talk about music or TV you both like. \n\nHang in there!"
8,"My wife likes when she is on top, but also likes when I'm on my side, she raises her leg up and I go in her from the side.  Both of those are her favorite positions.  \n\nI also found one where she was flat on her stomach and I managed to get inside her from a weird angle on top of her, and it was hitting her g-spot constantly and drove her nuts."
8,"If you are not sure how you feel about him, how can you say you want your love, for him, to grow? First and foremost, you need to KNOW how you feel before you do anything at all. Let nature take its course."
8,"Don't sit around and try to figure out. If you like him go for it. It's worth taking a risk. But, if you don't and you're just wondering then you'll probably be wondering forever because it's hard these days to know if someone is crushing on you. Depending on your age, he probably picks with you often or tries to draw a lot of attention to you or not any at all trying to distract other guys from you. Just ask. He can't beat you up for it. He'll either say he does or he doesn't. And then you won't have to wonder anymore."
8,"she sounds bored.  try something new.  remember what it was like when you first met?  those feelings are still there, you just have to find them....be THAT GUY again for her...flowers on the pillow, candles, some alcohol, a motel room, you remember those days??  i have been married for 10 years and it is just as spicy now as it was then...just be THAT GUY again for her."
8,"I really don't think something like that can be forgiven easily, your mother put herself before you and your sister and when something like that happens you you cant help but fear for your own kids.  Lots of people talk about unconditional love but I think there is exceptions and this is one of those."
8,"Why waste your time?\n\nWhats he got thats so special you think you NEED him??\n\nGet some self esteem, move on to someone else who appreciates you and is worthy of your time & effort.\n\nThat guy sounds like a game playing idiot."
8,You need to get away NOW
8,It's the same in my house- 4 kids- the oldest is 9.  I'm glad my son still has some of his innocence..   Some 9 yr olds are hardened  by life by now. He'll find out soon enough I just hope it doesn't crush him or the kids at school are not mean to him.   Merry Christmas.
8,he is insecure and wants you to chase him. DONT! let him come to you. if you chase him it just makes him think that your a punching bag who will take a mans crap and its ok to be rude....
8,go to your yahoo inbox it will be there
8,"Why do you want to change?  Question your motivation to change.  Is it because you want to change someone else's impression of you?  If so, thats a lame reason.\n\nWearing your heart on your sleeve suggests your easy to win over.  If you decide to change, heres my suggestion.  Anytime anything or anyone comes into your life, follow this exercise.  Sit down and think what and where you want to be in 5 years or 10 years.  Then think of that person or thing, and if it isn't part of the 5 year plan, its simply a diversion.\n\nIts probably not acceptable to say 'don't spend any time on diversions', because we all need them and want them.  Instead, limit the time you spend on your diversions."
8,really im willing.im a girl
8,i say hes not worth your time and he doesnt know what he wants so let him be the one that got dumped. dont let him hurt you
8,"Be warned: you may not like this answer. \n\nEvolutionary Psychologists has an answer on this issue.\n\nThey say women are more into ""affiliation"" , where as men are more into ""competition"" due to natural selection.\n\nThe reasons are a little complicated, but in a nutshell (or ice cream cone if you like) they say women have to ""invest"" in her partner to be able to sustain quality living during the cumbersome and troublesome pregnancy.\n\nHowever men who are more interested in others, (meaning: showing less affection for one individual) have higher ""score"" in their love life, ergo more offspring that tend to be like them. So they show short term interest (i.e. lie).\n\nSo women try to save more, men try to invest more. The best way to save and enthrall a man is to express your feelings. Yet men has no such natural obligations (until...), so they stop complimenting you with their interest and feelings after a while.\n\nIt's only natural, and of course women are right about men when they call them ""ungracious, disloyal, etc."".\n\nOf course for the exact same reasons men are right about calling women as contriving, scheming, overbearing, etc.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nCheck out that predator who shows the ""sensitive man"" trick. The obvious sugeestion that you will find the ""right man"" somehow points to the very person who offers the comfort."
8,"Love is a profound feeling of tender affection for, or intense attraction to, another. People in love are often considered to have ""good"" interpersonal chemistry. Love is described as a deep, ineffable feeling shared in passionate or intimate interpersonal relationships. In different contexts, however, the word love has a variety of related but distinct meanings: in addition to romantic love, which is characterized by a mix of emotional and sexual desire, other forms include platonic love, religious love, familial love, and the more casual application of the term to anyone or anything that one considers strongly pleasurable, enjoyable, or desirable, including activities and foods. This diverse range of meanings in a single word is commonly contrasted with the plurality of Greek words for Love, reflecting the word's versatility and complexity.\nclick here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love#Overview"
8,kiss me and RUN!!!!!!!! lol
8,How about just coming out and asking her?  If she says no she is either lying and you don't want a liar back or she really doesn't want you back and feels you are better a friends rather than a couple.  OR she says yes and you have decisions of your own to make.
8,"Yes I do, I feel that it is better to have loved once, than to have never loved at all.Even though the man I love knows that I love him, and doesn't talk to me, I would've rather loved him, than have never have loved him at all, because without him, I couldn't breathe."

Just try to have a positive outlook on it, that's what I would do so that is my advice!"
8,"Make sure she's plugged into the wall, then press the left nipple to boot her up.\n\n;-)\n\nAs far as signals that she's turned on:\n-Touching you for extended periods\n-Touching you close to your genitals\n-Slow, heavy breathing\n-Dilated pupils\n-Lower lip protrusion\n-Loose jaw, slightly open mouth\n-Licking lips\n\nMany more, but these are the most prevalent.\n\n---\n\nHow do you turn a woman on?\n\n""The most sensitive sexual organ on a woman is the one between her ears."""
8,"Most men are out of shape and sex is like a workout.  Men move a lot and concentrate a lot during sex and these cause men to sweat.  If your man is sweating too much, then try to get him in better shape.  Have him start jogging or doing some kind of aerobic exercise so that sex is not such a workout for him.\n\nIf he is in better aerobic shape he will also have better blood flow and that will make his sex tool larger and harder."
8,Yah.But most of them are gay..........!
8,if its a problem 4 you see a dr but from a womans point of view you all should curve upwards some to hit the g spot and all a little easier less effort 4 you yea
8,take things slow...and see what happens
8,"Ive been in love like that and all you can do is keep telling him how you feel. For me, I feel like i cant breathe when hes not around. But its a good feeling not a bad one. Let him know he is the only man for you. That you can never ever feel like this for anyone else. Let him know that your heart beats for him, that you wake up everyday thinking of ways to make him happy, that you love him unconditionally. That you are his forever. If all else fails, tattoo his name on your butt! LOL"
8,"forget her. she treated you badly this time, it WILL happen again. you deserve better."
8,You are beautiful and yes mine does.
8,Nah cos seven ate nine....
8,"Well, the only way you will know if he likes you if you ask him yourself. It's a 50/50 shot...It will be either YES or NO!!!!! I think the answer will be yes. Blindly he has taken the first step and I say you should take the second step to find out. Good Luck and let us know how it goes!!!!"
8,well when i first got engaged i ran around for 2 weeks showing my awesome ring off then i planned the wedding took me 2 years but it was great
8,TRY..............BIDZ.COM............................really good site. Jewelry very good value. Some even have free shipping.  Also try ....JEWELRY TELEVISION.com...........they have some amazing deals.  Can go tp web site or on television.  Good Luck
8,a guy with who i'm studying/working.. but i'm not sure if he would like the same thing.. can you maybe give me an advice :)
8,"Her ability to allow her inner self to shine, and not be afraid to show the great attributes she has."
8,"I did... it was a heck of experience.. really out-of-mind... It was in the inside-bathroom of my ex-boss office and his secretary entered twice without noticing I was there... But then we needed to left the place... So she went out walking out of the office like nothing happens and I did the same 10 mins later, that was funny....\nAnd tks for not letting me forget such a good time....."
8,"I don't know the story. But if he really regrets whatever he did then it's okay, and he's one lucky motherf###er."
8,"..Yes there right...(sadly though theres nothing wrong with being shy)..that is untill it interfers with your life & slowly engripts U in it's will.\nBut it sometimes just takes time...time to say:Y do I let this dominate me,I can get rid of it...face it in battle & win! If she can..then incourage her.\nIm shy to,but sometimes being shy can work to your advantage.\n-megnalon"
8,"Move from online personas to the phone... just tell him one night while you're chatting online that you'd like to hear his voice as he's cracking jokes - makes it more personal. Then from there, you two should be able to slowly move from the phone to in person without too much awkwardness.\n\nSome relationships don't survive the online to face-to-face move... but friendship will always remain if you keep at it. Best of luck!"
8,"Is this love?  It does not sound like it to me.  If you loved either and you knew it, you would not feel confusion.\nAs for romance, you make your choices and you take your chances.  If you heart is not screaming that you do not want to live without one of these girls then you might end up living without either."
8,How the hell should we know!
8,"to begin with 'you go girl' you did good with the ro on him.  remember that he is a man,  they are very different beings.  they have to be in control 'i think that is the 'cavemen' in them'.   he might need you to get really hard on him. let him know that no means no by not having ANYTHING to do with him. nothing, zip, nada, zero.  close the book on this chapter it is over.  good luck and blessed be"
8,sure..if he gets to know you he might ask you out ;)
8,"I understand how you feel but you must not dwell on these kinds of feelings.... volunteer for a something that you enjoy....spend a lot of time outside, noticing all the beauty in the world, get active and try to exercise (that's always good for depression) try to spend your time with people who will bring you UP and not DOWN, most of all learn to LOVE yourself, this is so important....you truly can't be happy with someone else unless your happy with YOU!!  This took me a loooong time to attain but I finally got there and you can too!!  I'm 36 and I'm still looking to meet the right person or to have that person realize that they want me.....I don't know that I will ever ""find"" someone but I sure intend on enjoying my life in the meantime!!!\nGood luck!"
8,What you call rationalizing probably comes off as patronizing.  Try listening for a change and get what the woman is saying to you.
8,Girl he is a big mama'sboy and you need to tell him that he needs to grow up and talk to you now because honey you are giving him something Mommy can't .so try giving him some good loving and talk to him in that soft voice and tell him how he makes you feel left out. girl you have the power work it girl . I wish you all the best .
8,"I agree, it's very crazy that so many men cheat when their wives are pregnant. If they didn't want us in that condition, they should have kept a wrapper on it. \n\nSeek counseling. Passive aggressive behavior can be a real problem for some people, and in extreme cases, they turn violent during their ""aggressive"" phases. You don't ever want things to go that far where he might take out his insecurities on you, your son, or your new baby. In addition, his infidelity isn't something you are going to get over easily. It will take a long time, and a lot of work on his part, to re-build what he so carelessly threw away. A professional can help you both work through these issues, whether it's a clergy member, a psychiatrist, a licensed therapist, or whatever you choose. It doesn't really matter as long as you both are open and honest, the person can help you to find a way to get back what you two are missing."
8,"Don't just like him back because you now know he likes you.  Get inside your ""Heart"" and see if you feel anything for him....more than just a friend.  Usually best friends make great spouses.  My husband is my best friend and we have a wonderful marriage with love, trust and communication."
8,"My best friend is an excellent liar, he's lied to me so many times that I reallly don't think that I will ever know just how much he's lied to me.  The good thing is that I know the way he is now so I now know not to trust him immediately.  In the back of my mind there is always the thought that he could be lying to me.  So I simply don't trust him any more.   I don't know if this helped you or not.  If other people see your friend as a liar then it might be true.  Just go with your gut feeling."
8,its not difficult check the personal websites
8,You are only 15. Wait to find out if you are in love when you have meet other guys. You think you are in love now because he is who you have.
8,"""I enjoy our friendship and wouldn't want to do anything that might jeopardize it. So while I'm flattered that you've asked me out, I would prefer to keep things as they are. Thank you."""
8,"My advice is to get over it. You could try to get closer to her through her friends, let her know the real you! But don't push it! Some things are not meant to be. Nontheless, there is plenty of fish in the sea!"
8,take the first step if he is not willing to...meaning just walk by and say hi..then let him do the rest
8,"That depends on how old your grandfather was, plus tjhings where just that way back then."
8,how to make money\nhow to find an HOT FUCKBODY\nhow to become famous\nhow to show his folks his power\n... FUCK!! all the things i think ... :))
8,After he has told you! Simple.
8,She may just be playing with your heart and emotions. Ask her what the deal is.
8,"A real man and friend would tell his friend the truth.  Don't be stupid and do his wife.  Just because she hot doesn't make her not act like a ho.  She's desperate right now and trying to get out a situation because she got caught.  Thinks of this, if you do her, she could be a real b**** and flip it around and tell her husband that you came on to her.  Not only will she get out of her situation with him but she'll get out of her situation with you with a bonus from you to boot.  Tell him and whether he believes you is his problem.  Let him know that you have no reason to lie.  If he ends your friendship over this, trust me, she'll be stupid enough to screw up again and get caught then he'll feel like a fool."
8,the punishment is that you ahve to support them
8,"No. Personally I think it is all about proportion when it comes to boobs. I mean like most guys I like big ones, but when a petite girl has small boobs it looks natural and I like it. I know lots of hot petite girls with small boobs. Most petite girls with large ones have fake ones anyway!\n\nSmall boobs can be really disappointing on otherwise curvy girls though.\n\nThere was a comedian that once said ""Big boobs and small boobs are like coke and pepsi. A guy may claim to have a preference but in reality he'll take whatever is on offer.""\n\nBeside that small boobs have their own advantages. They tend to not to be overly saggy and they age well. And as some wise man said ""more than a handful is a waste""."
8,"I think your mother didn`t try to hurt you. If you are maniac depressant, people around you should know it to better understand you. If your boy friend really loves you, it won`t chase him away."
8,"You know, if he shows no interest in what you're saying, then he's not ever going to.  And therefore, he's not interested in you.  Maybe in the physical aspect he is, but nothing more.."
8,"tried doing a backflip on my bike when i was about 6. on the broken curb. i did it halfway in the air. then i fell off the bike (still in the air), and dropped onto the concrete floor. then the bike fell on top of me."
8,"If I were you, I would comply and ask.  Just go over there and visit to start with.  Surely her parents aren't that strict that she can't have ""friends"" over.  The more they see of you I'm sure the more comfortable they will be.  Also from what you described, she appears to be the oldest.  Most parents are protective of their first born.  They will eventually have to cut the apron strings.  Be brave, if you don't step up and do this, someone else will."
8,the one with a great personality and a great sense of humor
8,you can either tell him and be laughed at or tell him and be loved back. maybe he likes you too. wish u luck.
8,"90minutes of full on raging boner, but in younger men it's more like 2-4 hours bepending on your metabolism, but be careful when that stuff wears off you ejaculate enough to make a porn star jealous.\n\nI'm healthy and decided to try it anyway, not the best Idea"
8,"In a way, but then you get to steal the grandkids and spoil the s**t out of them..."
8,"Yes..... that's why my GF and I aren't rushing into marriage yet.  Once I get my degree and start making good money (hopefully), then we'll get married.  Right now, we are eligible for help and it helps with taxes, etc.  Sad but true."
8,"I get upset because they are more worried about bathroom time then I am.  I mean c'mon, Imma chick and I take like 20 minutes to shower and do all that other stuff that girls do, I guess I dont understand why they gotta take so much TIME!!!"
8,"No, not really\nY? Has it happened 2 u? \nDon't worry it's ok, u just have to tell ur mom"
8,"If she gave you her number, she's probably sitting by the phone, waiting for you to call!\n\n(Go ahead!)"
8,"Have you emailed him to ask him what's going on? Text and email him both and ask. Tell him that if he's ok and simply doesnt want anything to do with you, to please tell you so you can stop wondering if he's ok. If he is ok, and just couldnt contact you for a while, ask him from now on, to tell you if he's going to be out of touch for a while and/or if he's mad or wants nothing to do with you to say so........the silence is confusing and scary. Explain that.I am sure he is just involved in something and cant get back to you. I'm sure it bothers him too...wondering what you must think!  Good luck!"
8,"OH please, don't get me started *LOL*\n\nI have had the same dilemma in my last two jobs. Working under someone with less qualifications, certifications, knowledge, intellect can really suck. \n\nYou can sit back and take it or you can fight back, intelligently, or you can up and leave. But no matter what you do be careful, I finally got out of my situation and went to worse, tenfold. You will always be in this situation to some extent. Most managers/supervisors are book smart but reality ignorant. And we all know that it is never how much you know it's who ya blow."
8,i think you have your own right to name your child what ever you want and it does not depend on what other people think of the name and it sounds like a very interesting name to me
8,Only you know which boy you like the most. You sound young and will in all probability have many boyfriends before you settle down. Go with your gut feelings on this. ↑
8,"find some sexy lingerie.Tell him 2 wear only underpants or boxers,nothing else.take him into ur bedroom,lay him down on a bed,stand in front of him,take off ur lingerie,then start having sex,one that both of u will remember 4 life"
8,It's only bad if it prevents you from being interested or able to perform with your spouse when needed.
8,"most people cannot come out and just say ""i don't like you."" and even more people cannot come out and say ""you're my second choice, sorry.""\n\neven though we all know what it means, it is still easier to say ""i'm not interested in a relationship right now"" than to say ""i'm not interested in you."" because we are trying to spare his feelings.\n\nthere are some girls who can be frank. there are some guys who wish that girls were more frank. but on the other side, some girls cannot be straight forward and some guys appreciate that girls are not straight forward."
8,*dont talk to much but just enough to make them want to know more about you.\n*present yourself respectfuly.\n*dont discuss politics or religion if you dont know enough about the person to know if your affending them.\n*dont show irritation.\n*try not to be very repetative about anything.\n\n    just my personal do's and don'ts!\n                 good luck!!
8,sure... in mexico.
8,He is WAY to old to be running around the house in his underware. I am surpised his friends haven't said anything to him. Most guys do not want to see another guys drawers! Tell Mom to lay down the law and make this boy put some clothes on. Sweatpants and warm-ups are comfortable too. If he needs that much comfort he can hang out in his room with his door closed.
8,"It's so so...I'm not into blondes, sorry.  I do have a suggestion.  Only if you would like to have your entire avatar show up do this:  Scroll to the bottom of this screen and click on ""Tell us what you think.""  Type in this suggestion:  “On Yahoo Questions/Answers please add the capability of having our entire avatar show up when we place our mouse over it.  It wouldn't take up any extra space this way.  I think it would be fun to see the whole thing!"""
8,"I have a friend like that, what a bore! hahaha\nUsually people that are like that are incredibly insecure about themselves so they employ different methods to make themselves feel better.\nFor example: acting better than you all the time can make you start to feel like crap about yourself. It's a cumulative effect, so just ignore it and know you're the better person.\nAnd they control who you talk to because they don't want you to realize how sad and lame they are, so they control the possiblility of you making new friends and leave them.\nSo, keep your head up, ignore her, and make all the friends you want to."
8,"Its not so much as just faking the big ""O"" but there are a few reasons that I can think of why I did it.  For 1, I just wanted it to be over.  The Guy was a total ass with a package that He just didn't know how to use.  He enjoyed it more than I did, and he wanted to keep pounding until I came, so I faked it.  Reason 2, is that you are enjoying him, but hes just not hitting the spot right.  Doesn't mean that it didn't feel good, just means that he is trying his best to please you, but is not hitting it right.  By faking the orgasm you make him feel like he has satisfied you."
8,he treats you more like his girlfriend than one of the guys.\nhe gets jealous if you talk or flirt w/other guys.
8,Ask your mama.
8,Get pregnant - then you'll have to marry him.
8,"Maybe because when you love someone, you tend to notice every single thing they do - be it big or small. Everything they do is important to you, which is why a small mistake may cause a  fight."
8,Maybe she is having a low sex drive right now and do you spice things up in the bedroom and make things exciting for her???? Talk to her and see why she feels this way and also suggest to her maybe seeing a doctor or sex therapist. She could be having affairs too!
8,"You know its true love if you love them no matter what they do, you cant stand to be away from them, you cant see yourself without them in the future, and last but not least.. you feel like.. yourself..."
8,Ask 1 of ur pals to distract the friend!
8,"dont wait show him that your interested, by talking him to do something with you, then at the end of the predate ask him if he would like your phone number and call you sometime. the reason why not to wait is bc good guys are shy, and sometimes back down bc they feel insecure that u really like them back, so u will have to make the first move; then see where it goes; i know girls r used to guys doing it but too me you shouldnt wait for him to get over insecurity u should comfort and tell bc most guys dont know girls like u love them back"
8,Yes. There is too much age difference. I wouldn't do it
8,what they charge and give a tip if they are good
8,"she probably thinks your cute \nI'm guilty of staring and thinking guys are cute and have a boyfriend I love at the same time.\nthis girl might be thinking of dumping her boyfriend, i dnt know. but if you're interested in her, i would still talk to her anyways so you can see."
8,"You're the woman.\n\nYou make the rules as to how much is too much and how much is too little.  Isn't that really what you want to hear?\n\nIf he didn't want to hang out as much, you'd be asking how you could MAKE him hang around more.\n\nWomen like you are interested in mindless drones who capitulate to your every whim.\n\nSounds like you got one.  Set your limit and enjoy."
8,"Certainly!  If they're physically fit and well-toned, that is a huge turn-on.  However, I do not appreciate those with ""man-muscles"" attributed to steriods or other means that make them look like male bodybuilders.  It's disgusting to see these women try to emulate that.  However, a female form with a hint of 6pack abs is a total turn-on>"
8,"Unless you write her a poem and email it to her, I think you are a little late for that. Maybe even a song!"
8,Tell your friend that he is a piece of sh*t and that she needs to ditch him. But do not tell her that he is trying to get with you.
8,"im from ontario, is that close"
8,"When urs is erected, treat it like the gear in ur car! pull it down, stretch, pull it right, left. move it in circular motion. \nActually it is stretching exercise like we do to be more tall. we warm our body up and hang ouself somewhere to be tall. But with our penis this warming up is done when we are erected(cause blood flows to ur genitals then) and stretching will do the rest. (but hey..dont let that come out of it)"
8,"It is tough to find, isn't it?"
8,Take her somewhere... plan a special day.  Make it all about her.  I get depressed during winter because it's always so cold and gray.  Just try to brighten her day a bit!
8,"I'm with Ryno on this one.\n\nThis happened to me, too. She was 14 and I was 19. I don't think I went as far as Ryno, but she admitted to me her age the night we were ABOUT to do something.\n\nIf you are under 18 you should leave him alone for a few years. All you're doing is putting him at risk. If he's been silent for 2 weeks, assume that he wants to keep it that way. Don't encourage him to resume your relationship with him.\n\nChances are there will never be anything between the two of you at any point because you lied about your age--even when you're no longer a minor. People don't forget that stuff. If you do resume things at a later point he'll probably hang that over your head anyway.\n\nLet it go and date people under 18."
8,Do you really think some chick is going to expose herself as a friggin s|ut?
8,you could but if you gotta be somebody your not then dont!you would have to put on an act all the time.just be yourself and express your true feelings to her.
8,"The bible is a book written by men who have an agenda.  The weak minded will choose to listen to propoganda.  Saved from what...a fable.  Think of it...after all this time suddenly Judas goes from being the traitor to the most loyal?  Wow, what a turnaround.  We were wrong for the last 2000 years.  What will we learn tomorrow...it's all just a fairytale?  Get a grip on your own life and stop allowing organized religion to influence your mind for money, control and power."
8,depends.\nIf it's meant to be then It's meant to be.\nYou can't control the heart.
8,"If I knew I had a totally awesome body and took a totally sexy picture of myself...Getting wet wouldn't be a problem!\n\nBut, if it's sunny out you could have a problem & you might have to go find the D batteries!\n\nHalloween isn't that far away....Can I dress up as Conc Boy?\n\n>:-)~\n\nOwlwings, Might be time for a check up from the neck up."
8,women who make the first move.
8,Not love bites but definitely passionate kisses
8,Hell yes.  She wears them jeans every night with them cameltoes just begging to be sucked on.  Given the chance I would jump on it in a heartbeat.  Regardless of any consequences it may have at the workplace.
8,i think the're both good.But I am going with love because you can have a friendship and be in love with the person!
8,"Keep yourself busy caring and loving those that are near to you. Embrace life, think of all the good things in your life. Fill the void with the things you love to do and never found or took the time to do for yourself. Walking down new avenues can often lead to new encounters."
8,to make the word a little shorter? i dunno lol
8,"It all depends on how you define love.  I 'love' all my friends, but I don't want to get married to them or anything!  Love doesn't have to me romance... it can indeed just mean being close to someone and caring about them. Some people, however, might not be comfortable saying they 'love' their buddies... it depends on what love means to you.  Men especially don't throw around the term too often, because women tend to read more into it than they should.  Keep in mind there is a big difference between caring a lot about someone and being romantically interested in them."
8,"Just stop. Stop the calling to say you can't talk, and stop emailing and wondering and asking and being hurt and expecting friendships and things. Your friends are right. Don't even try to talk to him. Wait, and call in in 6 months if you must."
8,"Easy! Everytime you think of him or see him just teach your mind to remember one thing. He's got STD's! Stay away from him! Run, Run Forest Run!! And you should be ok."
8,"no idea WHAT you are talking about\nyou've been married 10 years and he wants other women now?\numm, he's not too committed  to you then"
8,not if he didnt cum
8,"Well I guess it depends of each girl, but for me: A solitaire, silver and princess cut. I guess it also depends if  you are going to buy the engagement ring separately than the wedding set. If the engagement ring is going to be part of the wedding set then yes a bit flashy would be nice, but if the wedding set is separate then the engagement ring, then the engagement ring should be simple. I hope that made sense! \n\n~browneyes~"
8,I know what you mean about the limits but they do that so that you earn more points to get better limits. I didn't see that one. I wish him the best and hope his cry for help was answered...K
8,"It'll need open minds which will accept the truth that soliders out there are only worsen the whole matter,they kill innocent ppl&get killed.\nTheir holy war lost its credibility by the increasing realizing of ppl of the world that it was all lies.It was only about domination&colonialism not freedom at all.\nTurn back home...live...& let live......"
8,"I have to agree with springo 88, it is an unwritten rule in life that if you want to date a friends ex, you don't!! and if you are serious about it, you must tell your friend everything and ask if it is okay to seek a relationship with their ex, and If they say they would be uncomfortable with that situation..then you better respect their wishes and find someone else or you have no right to call yourself anybody's friend!!! boyfriends and girlfriends will come and go but you should be loyal to your real friends and find someone who will not cause any tension between you and your friend..best of luck to you !!"
8,A box of shotgun shells only cost about eight bucks. That would fix everything. Or. Just put yourself into prison now and take the short cut.
8,"hm... this sounds like a tough one. But this is the opinion that i've drawn from what i've read. It sounds like this girl is interested in you. when she says hi to you does she ask you any more questions about you? for example 'what's up?' because if she does, then i think that she definitely has a crush on you because she's trying to find out more about you and trying to get more involved in your life. but if she doesn't ask you any more questions after saying hi then she is probably just being friendly, or she's trying to get you to open up more and start a conversation with her.\n\nGood luck,\njane"
8,I am sure he is
8,spend more time with him and rly flirt cus then he will get the message
8,"my parents are divorced, and have been since i was 4 years old. i've had a great childhood and i thinnk that everyhting worked out for the better. not only were my parents happy, i lived in an environment without fighting/ marital problems. my parents have joint custody, so i've lived with my mom but can visit my dad on weekends or as i please (when he isn't working). in addition to my parents and siblings being happier, my parents have both remarried, which i think has ben a great experience and i greatly love both of my step-families."
8,"If you want the kind of stability that you can have with marriage and you know this relationship isn't headed that way, why are you still in it? Any relationship requires respect, honesty, faith, trust compassion and communication. And if you're not getting these things do you think it would be fair to bring a child into the middle of it? If things are not what you want them to be now, having a baby probably will not change things. You need the solid foundation in your relationship first and then a baby can add to the joy. You will need to have an honest open convesation with your guy about what he thinks about the relationship and the two of you need to decide what direction you would like it to go. If he doesn't want the same things, you would be better off to find someone that shares your dreams and desires."
8,"the sad truth is a lot of men cheat and they don't need any real reason for it other then having someone around willing to cheat with them, I'm so sick of hearing men say we are wired different and have no control over that type of behavior, that's a crock of shit , but I will say men like that are worthless to women and children because their whole purpose in life is their own satisfaction."
8,You should move on!! To start with he cheated on you and even after you forgave him which i never understand that but people do he still lied to you about little stuff. This guy you will never be able to trust. You have already given him too much information to play you with. He knows that you still love him and that you think of him all of the time and its hard for you to move on talking to him. So the next time he calls blow his mind. Tell him your fine just been hanging out with friends and even found a guy that caught your eye. I bet that will end that. Dont subject yourself to being hurt again. There is more than one guy out there and you deserve a good one!! Move on and dont look back.
8,"Yes they do. Taking a year out to go travelling, having a gap year expedition... loads of girls do it."
8,"People's first impressions are usually visual, so I personally shave my head, exercise frequently, and brush and floss regularly.  \n\nAfter that?  I try to have a varied number of interests and stay abreast on current events.  I make a point to be honest and upfront, I appear trustworthy.\n\nBut what I wrote above is really common sense.  What you need to be asking is what kind of females do you want to attract?  You need to identify what you are attracted to.  You need to find out where those types of females hang out and go after them there."

8,"You can't help the way you feel, it is being human.  I had a similar situation when I was 17.  I had been best friends with him for 2 years and gradually we got closer and closer.  For me it didn't work out but I am glad I gave it a go otherwise I would all ways wonder what if.  I think life is far too short to have regrets."
8,"Their eyes usually give it away.  If not, ask what the deal is."
8,Oh yes I definatly agree. There is no way you can forget a loved one. But you also cannot remember someone you never met.
8,First you need to open up her sexuality by helping her see women as sexy.  If you have not went down on her yet...do so it might open her up more and take her out to a club or bar that you know has women willing to swing.  Get her drunk ...Get her kissed by another women ag it on...Get her to dance with other women and let her know how sexy you and every other guy in the place think she is...Then you will have her right where you wanted her...
8,"I am out to get you, but for a completely different reason!"
8,i would want to be complimented on. like my shoes or that i have a good perfume on.
8,Before we all went our seperate ways to college my best friends and I went midnight bowling and had a sleepover party! We made so many fun memories just being silly together...no matter what make sure you take TONS AND TONS of pictures and make copies for everyone to take with them!
8,I think you meant June.   6-6-06
8,"Run, any boy who says he has his girlfriend on lock down, is not a boy you want. He would try the same thing with you. Don't tell his girlfriend, if he really has her on lock down she won't believe you anyway."
8,"Naomi Watts is more glamorous and elegant.  Jennifer Aniston is cute and easy going.  If you like classy girls I'd say Naomi, if you like fun and laid back girls I'd say Jennifer.  They are both very ""hot"" though."
8,Get an attorney in your local jurisdiction
8,no it is not wrong.
8,"if it could be bought, i would buy u everlasting love."
8,I think that what ever you feel is normal for you.\n\nand all  your friends wont agree or feel the same as you do.  \nSome might want or ask you to act a way that doesnt feel normal to you.  But don't ask them to do it.\n\nJust be yourself and you will see who your true friends are later.  good luck\n\nstef
8,Go to a family tree geneology site.
8,"Just say "" God its hot today i'm smelling of sweat,I must smell so bad.Bring out some spray and spray yourself and offer the kid some spray at the same time.Works everytime so try that good luck!!!!!"
8,"8th grade, because you get away with everything because you are on your way to high school. i think high school being ""the best 4 yrs. of your life"" is a bunch of balony"
8,love will find a way
8,"Nope, just desparate.\n\nYou sound like my evil twin dude. Exact same situation except you seem to be stepping up your effort while I really couldn't give a lesser f***. Maybe I'm the evil side.\n\nTo me, the whole thing with women is they expect us to go to all this effort, driven on by our hormones, and all they do is stare at us and make eyes like we're supposed to use that as an excuse to approach them.\n\nRecently, I said *#&$ it. If all women can muster is to stare at me and flip their hair then they can all go to he**. I'll leave it up to circumstance whether I find a wife or not, otherwise I've got better things to do and I don't need to waste time satisfying hormones.\n\nYou don't gotta feel bad about doin' s#*% like this because that's what it comes down to if you want to get anywhere with females. You gotta put it all on the line while they sit there and decide if your doing enough for them, and if you're not; they throw you out like last year's shoes.\n\nI'm certain there's better things to life than females at this age like playing sports, developing skills, getting a solid education and finding a worthwhile career that can be totally satisfying. All I ever hear women talking about is their boyfriends and relationship crap like that. I have no interest in anyone that dependent or shallow. If I happen to come across an independent, self-motivated and self-confident female who has definite goals other than making suckers out of guys like me, then maybe I'll consider changing my tone.\n\nI wish you the best of luck dude."
8,"There's no easy way.  You need to be really honest with her for a long time.  Make sure it doesn't seem like your hiding anything.  Make your life and your schedule an open book.  Make sure you can be contacted at any time, and tell her exactly what you're doing whenever she asks.  Don't delete the records on your caller id or cell phone.  Don't hide emails or IMs from  her.\n\nIf she didn't break up with you, then she's willing to try to trust you again.  You just have to be very open for a long time."
8,"That makes them someone you wouldnt want to know anymore, its a kind of betrayal."
8,"Nobody said life would be easy. Everybody has problems, some bigger than others. All you have to do is remember that you're not the only one and that the problem will eventually end. Also, remember that no matter how bad you have it, somebody is going through something worse. Hope this helps. \n\nPraying for ya!!"
8,"For some people, just holding hands is a big step.  Different people have different levels of intamacy.  While holding hands to you is probably a minor step, he may see holding hands as a big step in a relationship.  For now, respect his being open and honest enough to tell you that he isn't ready to take that step."
8,"There is not much you can do. she is in love with the man and she is an adult so your parents unfortunately don't have much to say and should  support her in whatever choice it is that she chooses to make\n\nYour sister evidentally sees something in him that you cannot see and that is what counts. YOUR SISTER is the one that is marrying the guy and she knows him better than anyone else does. She is following her own heart and that is what counts\n\nLove your sister and support her. \nLet her make her own choice and if it is a bad choice and she gets hurt, then show her support and do what you can to comfort her. \n\nFor now, let her make her own choice."
8,"Mother/Son dance can be done with the Father/Daughter or seperate.  I have seen it both ways and not at all.  At our wedding we did it seperate and my husband let his mother choose her song, he wanted it to reflect her and not him.  \n\nSome choices...\n\nI Hope You Dance\nThe Rose\nInto The Mystic\nAny Kenny G (since there are no words)\n\nAfter the dances many people try to play music for all generations and liking.  Most bride/grooms dont get much time to dance and are to busy mingling and other duties to even pay attention to the music.  We played a variety from all musical era's to accomidate our guests since they were there for us and we were there hosts we wanted to accomidate them so they would be comfortable to dance and have as much fun as we were."
8,"You can't expect the rough roads you will encounter.  No marriage is perfect.\nExpect differences, then talk to work them out.  Take the time to know each other and reserve time for this.  This will save ALOT of heartache and may prevent bitterness toward each other.\nNo one said marriage was easy, no one said it would too difficult to overcome.  \nIt takes sacrifice and work and true commitment to the other for it to succeed."
8,"Dress nice, clean yourself up a bit."
8,i guess this whole world is a big family. we love one another. :)
8,"Dump her now.  Not because she is bad for you, but becuase you are bad for HER.  If you are so shallow that you can't get past her waist size, then get away from her.  If she has no self respect because of her weight, she won't have the guts to leave first, you do it."
8,"What makes a girl cool and hot is when she is herself, no matter what that is. 100% tomboy.  50% 25% 0."

8,mmmmm depends on what sex drive you have some people have a high one and some dont!!! either way its good
8,"First, find out what it is she really said before you make any assumptions.Second,if you didn't do anything wrong and she really is calling you a brat then she's not worth your time.As for the spider thing...that's most likely the reason why she's not going over anymore."
8,If he loved you he wouldn't cheat on you.  I wouldn't say it was WRONG but you really should evaluate the worth of your relationship in HIS eyes as compared to yours.  Would you cheat on him?
8,dont be like me and wait for 7 years....ask her out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8,"Sometimes,\n\nYou pay for there company.  If they decide to have sex with you, that is there decision.  If they do not have sex with you, you have to pay them anyway.  You are not paying for sex.  Most of the time they will not have sex with you, but will spend time with you to talk or go out.  The ones that always have sex give the rest a bad name.  Usually guys get escorts to show off and do nothing else.  I have a friend who is an escort and has never had sex with a client.  Most of the time she is taken out to eat and then for drinks after.  She says that once you get the reputation for having sex, it will follow you around, but if they know you do not have sex, you will get the clients that want to go out to show you off."
8,"YOU BOTH r sick, should go to doctor to get help. You both r worse tha dog. Even a dog goes out to do it. I can't write anymore. Let me go to bathroom to vomit...in ur case let me go to ur bedroom to vomit..sick sick"
8,"obviously it's a cultural difference to plan engagement party before actually becoming engaged...but i'm not going to judge. hey, u and ur fiancee (and family?) probably have discussed this decision and want to celebrate it publicly...\n\nanyway, w/ that being said, here's some suggestions....\n==> decor: gold w/ red accents; silk damask tablecloths w/ candle as centerpiece; solid-colored napkin rings; fine chinaware; candles, candles, candles for an elegant romantic ambience. \n==> programs/shows: have u/fiancee traveled? spotlight the destinations by making a slideshow; spotlight/celebrate your own and ur fiancee's heritage as well...this also a way to involve older members of both families. \n==> to add european touch: include an amuse bouche/hors d'oeuvre before the meal/main course. (e.g. antipasto, apertif)\n\nincorporate asian/american flavor in the menu w/ each course...\n1st: pasta dish; 2nd: meat, like fish; 3rd: salad; 4th: dessert; 5th: cheese or something light like fruit coffee/tea; 6th: coffee, tea, or liqueurs, maybe irish coffee? \n\nhope this helps...congratulations!"
8,"uh...she probably doesn't want it if she's sleeping!\nHowever, if you must, try gently touching her, kissing her cheeks and neck.   But don't get on top of her of anything.  Try spooning or something.  But if I wanted my sleep, I really wouldn't want my boyfriend waking me up for sex, even if he was incredible in bed!"
8,"Put an ad in one of their papers.........Also further update with her name, someone here might know her and give her the details.  Good luck."
8,Remind the roomate that your and his relationship is strictly a friendship and that you would like him to respect you and your b/f's relationship tell him that if he cant stop the mind games he is playing with your b/f is upsetting you. Tell your b/f that you have no intrest in his r/m and reassure him how much he means to you. let b/f know how much the roomate's words are bothering you.\nIf not i am afraid you will loose your b/f or both.
8,"It depends, I don't mind when a woman makes the first move. I also don't mind if she let's me do the first move.  I guess its all a part of if you want something then go out and get it and not always do we get what we want.  I am for it.  It is OK if she speaks up first and if she makes the first move.  It can's hurt."
8,I went through the same thing and after I decided to go back with the old fling because I still loved him I remembered why I couldn't stand him.  Funny thing is I realized that the other guy I loved more.  Try to think back why it didn't work out in the first place.  Make a list to yourself about why you love one and the other and you might be surprised by the answer.  It may not be love your felling for both.
8,Get close to him and lean in to him feeling his butt and ask him just kiddin just be casual about ask him how he feels about u and see wat he says then work from then on
8,"Some women do.  For me a fat man would have to make up for it in other ways- nice features, tall, athletic, strong, intelligent, well-spoken, confident, rich"
8,I'm to far away.
8,"The ONLY right thing for you to do is to report it to the police.  She's in a vile situation with a monster, and if she's too afraid of reporting it, then be the best boyfriend that you can be and report it for her.  You can do it anonymously if you want to."
8,Book her an appointment for a pregnancy massage. She will feel like a new woman trust me. This is one of those anniversaries where the hubby is to pamper the wife...sorry. But maybe you can go out to dinner where you had your first date like my hubby did. Very romantic. Just let her know how much you appreciate her and be very sympathetic of carrying a baby (it is very hard in the last months). just a couple of suggestions!
8,"she was prolly busy, then again u did meet her online so yeah she probably did blow u off\n\nlol never trust a woman through the internet"
8,it is not a big deal as you think by yourself.just relax and meet with girls around you.any girl... and you will see that your problem is resolved then.
8,"Well if she said ""No"" to him and he can't respect that, then tell her not to see him anymore...  If she said ""No"" and he still did it, then you need to speak to your friend to report it....\n\nYou should not confront him or report it, because she told you in confidence.  When she is ready, she will do so...\n\nJust support your friend in any way that you can.  And try to keep persuading her to report it...."
8,It has worked out for people before but I would not get myself all high about it until you meet this person and spend some time togeather. Be cautious.
8,"With, or without as long as proper hygiene is practiced. I guess some women have a more definite preference. It is really more about your feelings for your sexual partner."
8,do you mean what is a girls ideal guy?\nwell we all have different answer for ur question dear and it depends on the girl if what kind a girl she is.\nur same as my age.anyway ummmm...i'll say you have to be urself ur real u not tryin to be someone ur not.you have to be a good guy not really that good but just fine coz sometimes when a girl fall for u she wont see all ur bad side as what they say love is blind.so good luck.
8,"My boyfriend thinks his first love is his true love..but you never end up with them.  But..you can also have a deep love for another maybe even deeper..and your first love can still be your true love.  I don't know...I think there's something special about the first person you ever loved..it's a new experience, a new feeling, and I think maybe part of it's falling in love w/the feeling.  It's like experiencing anything for the first time..then the more you do it, you get used to it and it's not as exciting you already know those feelings."
8,"tha ppl on here sayin their favorite pass time iz answering ?s on yahoo answers, they need 2 get a life, my favorite passtime is hangin wit my BFs!"
8,Nothing wrong with it. I always feel sexy!
8,This is a very interesting question.  I wonder if there is a scientific answer for this.  Let me google it.....\n\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11023208/  is a great link for reading about the connection between the heart and the brain.  This was a good question and I learned alot.  Thanks.
8,I think people in general care about you less and show less affection as you get older.
8,You are never going to find a PERFECT mate. Just one that is best suited for you..........\n\nGood luck!
8,"lol wow, you counted all that, cool! now i know"
8,"If I were you I have no clue what I would do sounds to me like your grandfather needs help. Anyhow my advice is to put him in a rest home, that way you dont have to deal with it. And your grandfather has a girlfriend? No offense but thats kinda messed up. Thats not something you hear everyday."
8,Check out theknot.com. They have lots of suggestions for each. I put there music & dancing link below..then you can browse through their articles.  Congratulations and Best of Luck!
8,Why would you wont to be friends with them? Unless you still wont to f**** them?  Be honest about it.  You people kill me with this Sh**!
8,yeah it does sound lame. Basically we are looking for a decent looking chick that laughs at our jokes that we can get in the sack without too much trouble
8,"believe ur mom he's right ,u will know some day"
8,"I'm afraid this answer is going to come from a 60 year old man. I hope you don't mind, and I hope my answer doesn't bore you.. In my grandparents days, as in my parents days, I don't think that LOVE meant the same as it did in my days. The reason I use the past tense, is because my died at the early age of 49 in a car accident. Are marriage was like being on a Honey Moon every day. We were married for 33 years. We were not only lovers, but best friends, as my wife would put it, Bestest Buddies!!\nTo answer your question does True Love still exist, I would have to say given the rate of failed marriages today, it is rare, because values have changed so much."
8,You should finish middle school before dealing with this stuff.
8,"I sure don't know...I'm one of those WBBWs with a handsome black man, and we've been together for 20 years.  But then, I don't stand a chance whenever Mo'nique comes on the TV screen...I just go in the kitchen and get him a towel for the drool...so I think we can fairly say he likes the big beautiful sistas, too! I do too, but I don't make a big point of it...I'm saving myself for Queen Latifah."
8,"Of course she can.  There isn't a law in place that states that.\n\nBesides, it's a free country and she's not a prisoner......or is she?"
8,"It's what goes on prior to sex in order to get your mind into it. If you're just in for a quickie, it's no big deal....but for a night of meaningful lovemaking, the foreplay starts hours before.....Maybe a phone call during the day of ""I can't wait to be with you tonight"".....a quiet, romantic dinner, with soft talk and lots of eye contact....and then once the time arrives, lots of gentle touches, soft kisses, etc. No rushing, no worries...."
8,"God, use this time to reconnect. The reconnection alone should do enough to spark your sex life. Vacation sex comes easily, oftentimes because since you are both removed from the everyday life that is usually the root of whatever problems you have with each other, you start to see eachother in the same light you met in, and it's a chance to fall in love again. Good for you!\nMy one word of advice for putting some spark into sex with a long term monogomous partner is to establish eye contact during orgasm. It's great! It feels like you are passing the orgasm into your eyes, like you are melting into the other person's soul. \nAlso, giving or getting oral with eye contact is interesting to play around with because some of us never get that intimate with our spouses; we just close our eyes and lay back. Try it, it will make you both vulnerable and closer at the same time.\nHave fun, guys!"
8,"okay... first off calm down...\ntake a deep breath! shes probably more intimidated of you than you are of her... just like with spiders... *cough* ANYWAYS\ni have a LOT of guy friends JUST friends\nit really helps to adjust hanging out with them and knowing how to act...etc. soo make some friends that are girls and JUST friends and pretty soon you will be suave...\n\nas for now: \ngo for it! ask her out! just pull her aside (not literally) and say ..""will you go out with me?"" thats all it takes...\nbut before hand take a deeeep breath and think to yourself...""suave,,,, confidant,,,,its ooookay"" and SMILE for god's sake!\n\nyou really have nothing to worry about... and i mean nothing... if she turns you down then dont sweat it there had to be a first! and dont forget to start just hanging out with girls... were pretty fun!"
8,"So what have you got to offer a lady? Are you smart? If ot, try reading (and don't move your lips while you do it). Are you good looking? If not, see about getting a make-over and remember to make the most of what you have. Are you fun? \n\nWork on making yourself the kind of guy women crave and you'll have to beat them off with a stick."
8,"I personally think you have made a smart move and are taking responsibility for what is yours. I would NOT stay with or talk with the ex girlfriend. (why mess up what you are trying to recreate). I can understand why you were made at your wife, but she is your wife and more importantly the daughter is yours."
8,"NO, focus on your education. Your spelling is atrocious, if you were to get her pregnant how would you support her and a child without even being able to spell words like SHOULD, WITH, or GIRLFRIEND."
8,"Have a real conversation, be honest with your feelings and direct...  If she tries to get together afterwards to ""just talk"" don't go for it, it's just going to be more painful on both of you."
8,"is she hot?????  She is just a lonely old woman, let her have some fun, she is probably glad to be able to get some excitement in her life."
8,"Tons of good luck.  But if the two of you still have feelings for one another, then I think your best bet is to take it from the beginning-act as if you never dated before.  My bf and I broke up for a short amount of time (something which I will regret for the rest of my life),but I got lucky and he took me back.  That is what I believe true love does.  Just remember to take it slow and not rush into any old feelings-make new ones to build upon the ones you already have"
8,HEy the more friends the better not unless your an stuck up kinda girl who is not into friends but into harassing the least beautiful. I say invite her and maybe you will find out that she is fun too.
8,i would love to...i want to because i know how sweet the fruit is....there is no reason i wouldnt want to.

8,Well coz. you can not change them.
8,she see's your heart and the warmth of your being as a person . that's what make you special and what only your girlfriend sees .

8,"it cant be taught, you just have to do it.  but be careful that you don't ram your tongue in their mouth... YUCK!"
8,"Ignore the phone call, unless it continues.\n\nResist the urge to respond to the immature behavior.\n\nI think it is good you are out of the relationship now and you should keep it that way. He was abusive and I am sure your self esteem went down the gutter.\n\nTreat yourself. Do something you always wanted to do but couldn't till now. Try seeing people and going places that have no relation to your ex.\n\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea to see a therapist and/or find a support group to deal with the abuse issues you went through."
8,"What difference does it make whether she was a virgin or not?  You did it anyway.  You weren't trying to save her in a pristine condition were you?  Get over it.  You don't believe her, don't trust her, then move on..."
8,"It's absolutely necessary to forgive yourself.  If you don't, you'll carry the guilt around.  So, yes, you can do it.\n\nIf you're having a hard time being able to do that, I would seek out a good pastoral or therapist referral.  Forgiveness is critically important in all aspects of life."
8,You just need to grow up and learn to trust people.
8,"68, 70 and 79 are not horrible grade, they are very decent marks and okay so you never got an 'A' but you did do very well and you can't get top grades all the time.\n\nReally you should have told your parents what you got and you shouldn't have faked their signature either.\n\nIf I was you I would tell them the truth now, I'm sure your parents love you and they wont be disappointed with a B+, they may be hurt you copied their signatures and lied to the school about showing them your marks, but they will forgive you."

Ok your job is basically to be there for the groom.make sure he gets to the church ect. but its more than this, he will have so much on his mind so you take care of the small things like making sure he has the rings ect. yes you organise the bachlors heres a tip if you want to score big with them both, no strippers or wild parties. the bride and groom are going to be pretty stressed and this could add to the stress. maybe just a really cool guys night out, think about it do you usually have wild uncontrolled parties when you usually go out?as for the mc thing that you will have to ask him, some best men are the mc sometimes there is a mc appointed!good luck its a privelage and honour to be asked"

8,"Why do you feel that you are being punished? He is probably afraid of what you are going to say or what will happen. I am sure he has built up all these expectations and is afraid that the phone call or meeting won't live up to what his is hoping for. Try and look at it from his point of view. He may also be afraid of hurting the mother and father that have raised him for the last 30 years.  Pray. Good Luck, I am sure if you give him time he will eventually call, when he is ready."
8,"HI. \nYour question is great. I couldn't resist it. You know, I want to say all kinds of tricky ways you could find out ...and what to look out for ..all that kind of stuff....But I honestly believe YOU have the answer to your question, What does your GUT feeling say ...not what you want to hear but really listen to what your guts instincts are telling you . Your gut will not lie to you ....ever..listen to your inner voice. Don't jump to conclusions.....at the same time don't just accept anything your told....you have everything you need inside of you. What is the character of the people telling rumors? telling a rumor in the first place is not a sign of good character. that is just my humble opinion. I am no judge that's for sure. Well here I go telling you what to look out for ..when all you need to do is listen to what the inner voice tells you ....it will not fail you. \nI wish for you the best that life has to offer!!\n\nPeace\n\nTrust in God ...BUT ...lock your car anyway!!"

8,"The best answer to this is a swingers site.\n\nMany couples prefer to play with single men for a variety of reasons - recovery time is one, the cuckold fantasy is another, and many women have a double-penetration fantasy as well - typically there is no male/male contact.\n\nIf you are interested in male/male contact, make sure you specify that in your ad, or response to an ad.\n\nThe advice about going to a swingers club was also good, make sure you call ahead to the club you plane to visit to be sure they allow single men, most do, but make sure before you go.\n\nSome sites you may want to try include:\nhttp://www.swappernet.com\nhttp://www.swinglesonline.com\nhttp://www.swinglifestyle.com\n\nFor a listing of clubs in your area visit:\nhttp://www.theswingersource.com"
8,I would talk to a lawyer.  I don't know what the situation is but I would tell the lawyer your situation.  You are the father.  Unless you have papers you have as much right.  Your children come first before any other disputes.  If it is only jealousy then they can be talked to but if there is any abuse whatsoever then  yes.  It doesn't make it any  better she will not tell the name of her boyfriend.
8,"Catch 22 mate! either way you ain't going to like it! if you say she cant have him stay she will hate you for it and say you don't trust her which also may lead to her going anyway and may even encourage her to sleep with him just because she is pissed at you! but if you let her go she might realise she misses him and they get it on anyway!\nThe best move you can make is go with them! let her know that you are fine with meeting her ex and your glad you can stay friends. pretend that it doesn't bother you and be all matey with them! by you acting confident and comfortable around them will show that you trust her, that you a confident your girlfriend loves you and wouldn't want to ditch you for her ex, and by being there at least you can keep an eye on him! at least if he does try anything you can give him a could dry slap! if your not a fighting man make sure that a couple of you mates are out that night or why not bring them with you!Tell you girlfriend you should all go out as a group introduce her ex to a few of your crew as if you want to make them feel welcome! if you need anymore help mate email me-jamescuckow@yahoo.co.uk. and good luck"
8,"To be honest, as dude, I have never cheated on a woman, but as a male, personally it sounds like a ""shovenistic pig"" statement, but as humans we all get bored, just like having the same breakfast dish every morning, you seek for something different.\nSome men never cheat, but admit while making love they think of other woman, other men just strait up cheat, in a way both of these solutions are still cheating, just one is mental.\nAs for respect, cheating is disrespect, but what  pisses me off most is when dudes physically harm women or verbally abuse them, or just treat them like shit, it may sound hypocritical to the statements made above, but I think women should be appreciated, and if you hurt a woman in anyway you have no honor.\n I remeber when Bill Clinton was impeached my mom would tell me all men cheat, and it doesn't matter he is still a good president, I really don't know if all men cheat. \n Also in a males perspective, I would hate to cheated on and I would want to know who she was seeing and I would also want to know why.\n Sorry to go on tangent, anyways just think of the relationship game as a boxing match, pick shots wisely, be patient, and if you don't want to get hurt, avoid big risks.\nThere is an abundance of dudes, sooner or later you should find someone who truly cares for you."
8,"Silence is powerful is a communication too, its important to find a way to interpret silence.\n\n   One way to start talking about something is to talk about nothing, that is, everything that is natural and espontaneous in the relation, another topic is that, why there is silence and how relevant or important is for building a better relation."
8,"well, i think u guys should cum 2gether and mebbe talk 2 him. make him undrstand that hes rong but dont tell him directly on his face coz he has ego and wont accept that. well thats all u can try i guess. gud luck"
8,yes no maybe so
8,You are both old enough to make your decisions.  You should not have to elope.  You need to be mature enough to face your family and tell them you are a adult and that you love each and everyone of them but this is the decision you have made.  They can except it or not but you have made the effort to stand up for how you feel.  They will eventually come around.  A good strong family will stand be side you what ever decision you make.  It may take them awhile to accept but they will.      \n\nWhen I  married my husband 27 years ago family could not stand him.  They disowned me.  It hurt me but I went on.  They eventually came around!!! Your family is just looking out for you best interest.  \n\nGood Luck!
8,yeah its hott\ndo you look like that ? if so thats GOLD!!!!!

8,"What I would do,  -and what I think you should do-, is take it very slow with the new girl involved. Honestly, it probably wasn't the best idea for you to get involved with her, but I wouldn't say to completely break it off now - that isn't realistic, and it would just hurt her because she would get your feelings twisted. \nYou have baggage. You can't make genuine transitions from person to person while carrying baggage; it'll hinder you. You'll always carry what was left from the old relationship into the new one, so forth, and so forth, and it isn't fair to the present person involved that your own issues are unsolved. It isn't a problem that you still think of your ex; it's actually very normal. You've completed an important step by acknowledging that your last relationship couldn't work, so now just prove to yourself why you deserve to move on. \nEver heard the song 'Bag Lady' by Erykah Badu?......that one goes out to you, lol.... Good Luck and God Bless."
8,"i'm from sheffield and it's grim here too,went out yesterday and it was fine..got on the bus and it threw it down!..but it was warm too which felt really odd..strange..very strange..ah well thats the good old british weather for you...but at least we don't suffer tidal waves or major hurricanes or tornadoes.."
8,"Your situation sounds very similar to my life story.  My wife and I got married very young, and I was not always very nice to her.  I drank a lot, and though I never physically abused her, I did emotionally.\n   She ended up becoming distant and looking for emotional relief in other men.  Never physical, but emotional hurts just as much.  I ended up meeting a woman, straying, and falling for her and it almost destroyed my life.\n   My wife and I go to counseling, which I suggest for you, and are working extremely hard to repair our marriage.  We are doing a good job, and things in many ways are better than ever, but there is still work for both of us to do.  In the end, ideally, we will have both grown stronger and love each other all the more because of all we have been though with each other.\n   This man is probably more of an infatuation than love because you are feeling things that you have missed.  Devote yourself to your husband, and him to you and remake better than before the love you had.\n   Get counseling, work it out.  Find you flame again.  If this does not work, than the only option left is to divorce, but this should be your last option, not your only option.\n\nGood luck."

8,"Being an ex smoker I can tell you that you cannot quit smoking for anyone but yourself.  The best you could do is explain to her that you are trying to quit and ask her to help you quit.  Most people know that quiting smoking is a quite the feat,  I still get complements for quitting an the time and it has been 3 years now for me.  You have to want to quit, that is the only way.  Try chewing gum (eclipse polar ice) that is how I did it!"

8,"Find out how she feels, but do so cautiously. you have yourself a very delicate situation. make sure that your feelings are strong enough to be worth the risk."
8,"Well I have a little experience so let me tell what I have done.  One of the things I have done is I made a short movie with Windows Movie Maker.  I just took the photos of our time together added some love music, and there you go.  Movie maker is quite simple and you can make something that looks decent.  Depending on where you live, maybe on a weekend take here to a cabin or resort.  Just go somewhere to get away from everyone and everything.  But the main thing is don't try so hard.  If you have been together for a long time be yourself, she will love that even more.  But try to be a little spontaneous suprising her every now and then with something special, i.e flowers, a poem, massages, etc."
8,"Don't get tricked into asking him out.  If he likes you he'll ask you out.  You're good enough to be asked out.  ""Just because you like to lead, doesn't mean he wants to dance."" If he likes you he will make the effort.  If he doesn't like you, you'll just make an ass of yourself."
8,"If your heart is telling you no don't stay with him always fallow your gut feelings.If he's someone you can't stop thinking about and you miss him when he's only gone for a short time then your in love with him no dout about it.If you know he's changing for you and wants to do better then he's in love with you too cause he's changing for you.I say don't live in fear you're in love this guy and he loves you too.He loves you so much that he's willing to change for you.He may have messed up in the past and did some hurtful things,but he wants things right again if he's changing his old ways for you then he means it this time and dos'nt want to mess things up again.I say stay with him and give him a second chance show him how much you love him by doing it.I hope that things work out the best for you and him."

8,"Hi there,\nI know that the pressure of being a virgin is extremely hard for one to handle, especially in the Western societies that we live in; but virginity is worth striking for.  \nI'm in my 20s and the group of friends that I have is also in their 20s and we are all virgins.  I think the most important thing that one needs to keep in mind is that virginity is for ONESELF, not for anyone else (or sometimes you might wanna save it for you future husband).  Once you are determined about it, it would be less difficult when you think of whether to have sex or not.  \nMy friends and I choose not to have sex before marriage b/c we see SEX as LOVE, and we respect our body as well as our partners'.  When you love someone unconditionally, you don't just want to own the physical body, do you??  Moreoever, when one has premarital sex, the wedding is not something that precious and special anymore, don't you think???  What is it special about the wedding night if you've already know everything about the other person???\nI also have friends who had sex in their teen years and most of them regreted later on.  Most of them lived for the moment and after that, they are the ones who ""loose"".  Plus, when we are in our teenage years, we don't really know what love is!!!  Believe me, when you find the one who really loves and cares for you, he wouldn't might if you want to save sex for marriage.  (My bf and I both compromise on that, and we're pretty happy).  Hope you find this a helpful!!  Good luck!"
8,"I understand ... I'm a single parent ... I work full-time Monday thru Friday 8am-5pm ... and clean 2 different offices once a week for extra money just to cover the child support I've never received.\n\nDo you know how hard it is to get any type of help from the system or whatever they offer to you ... I guess I make too much money ( and believe me .. I don't ) but I get to watch all these single moms sit at home with no jobs, get food stamps, get free schooling/day care, their kids eat free at school, they get government housing and I'm working my @ss off with 3 different jobs .. paying $ 900 in rent alone just to make it .. \n\nYeah pisses me off too !"

8,"Good for you!  I don't think I get the metaphor, but good for you nonetheless!"
8,"It sounds like he's interested in you and probably having the same problem you are having, not sure and afraid.  I think you should just come out an ask him.  If that's not possible for you, well, you could run your hands on his body and see how he reacts.  You could talk about openly gay things and people and see if he is responsive....by the way if you are both dancing in the same place and he's running his hands up/down your back, that seems like he's not shy and that you should have no problem simply asking...."
8,"I found that I get a great response from a man when I act dumb.\n\nBesides, it's known that men like to care for women too, we build up your macho when we do that..so why not?"
8,"You know , you are right..You proved yourself! Now they all look stuiped for thinking that the kids was not his! So, you won!!! Is that not enough of a hidden reason to forget it? They should never question you again about anything!\nBut where you start to forgive is to be forgiven! Go into your room, have a long talk with Jesus and get your forgiveness! Through the love of Christ you also will have a new start!\nGood Luck and Be Blessed..\n                                                     Rev.Susan"
8,It is said that the vein on the ring finger of the left hand reaches the heart directly and because the wedding ring is a symbol of true love it is worn in that finger.
8,First thing is you sit down and talk to him about what you think marriage is and ask him what he thinks it means to him. Then you ask him if he want to still be married and if he says yes insist on going for counseling. If he says he doesn't want to be married then you have your answer.....you leave.

8,"sometimes it's a matter of wanting to control your actions, sometimes it's because they don't know how else to communicate what they want--and they're afraid you're not even considering it.\n\nI absolutely loathe guilt trips. My family could staff a travel agency for guilt trips.\n\nHere's how I deal with it (which may not be your style, but it works for me):\n\nI'm very direct. I say, ""y'know, it makes me feel badly that you say this & this will happen if I do this or that.""  \n\nIn your case, I'd recommend opening up the channels of communication by saying, ""Do you think I'm just going to stay away after I move out?"" or ""What are you afraid will happen if I move out?""\n\nYou can also try communicating like this:\n\nwhen you do/say ______, I feel______ because______________.\n\nthat's called an ""I"" message--it's not attacking or accusatory, it simply states how you feel about something.\n\nI believe most people don't set out to make others mad intentionally.  I think they just don't know how to communicate what they want without manipulating because they've never learned how.\n\nI suggest stepping back mentally.  \nDad's probably under some stress because Mom's dying--he may feel helpless and alone, and with you leaving....maybe it's just overwhelming to him, y'know?\n\nWhen people are worried or scared, they get edgy.\n\nYou can certainly move out and still visit and help. In fact, it'd probably be better for you, simply because you'll have your own space and can deal with things at your own pace and with no pressure.  \n\n:)"

8,"I know how you feel. It seems no matter how much you do for them or how well you treat them they still disrespect you, show too little appreciation, and there never seems to be enough of a  balance, or reward in the relationship for men. IE women take more than they give and think about their own needs more than their partners. I can't give up though because I want to be happy with someone and will keep looking until I find that woman who gives as good as she gets"

8,I've been watching you!Kinda freaky huh?
8,"Perhaps you could ask her indirectly. Carefully crafted words are the key here to achieving your desired goal.....having a boyfriend. Okay, step 1) find a time when you and your mother are relaxing, no phones, dinner is finished, house is clean. 2) Begin the conversation like this: ""You know Mom, I am now ___ years old, and I was wondering if you would allow me to go to the movies with _____________. I know you have not had an opportunity to meet ________, but I can invite him by the house on _________. He is a really nice guy. Now, if you do not have a boyfriend, and no prospects, then I would suggest that you address your mother in this manner: Mom, I have really matured over the last year and I would like to respectfully request permission from you to go on a date occassionally with a carefully selected boy that I will bring home first for you to meet.  Don't be shy about it. Be assertive, without being pushy. Tell her what your heart desires, and do it in a kind, courteous, confident and mature manner. The way you approach this request to have a boyfriend is important. You have to let your mother know that you are ready for this big step in your young teenage life. \nNow, be honest in your evaluation of yourself here okay? Think! Really think here! And answer my question truthfully! Question: Have you been on your best behavior over the last year? Have you done everything that has been asked of you by your mother? Have you gotten into any serious trouble lately? Did you make good grades and behave appropriately in school? These questions are important, because if you have been cutting up and acting like a trifling little hoochie mama, it is highly likely that your mother will say no. But if you have been a perfect angel, and behaved appropriately over the last year, then I dont see any reason that your mother will not agree to your terms. Also, let her know that any boy you meet, you will bring them home to meet her, and your curfew is 9p.m. weeknights and 10:30 on weekends. Or, if your curfew is later than this, use your current curfew. Well, I hope this helps. Best wishes to you. And have fun."
8,"A bar is a good place.... but you could spend as much as $100 between your drinks and the drinks you by for various girls.  (the first girl you buy a drink for will most likely NOT go home with you, so you might have to talk to a few girls)  Or just go to a crappy part of your town a pick up a hooker for $10.  WEAR A CONDOM, 'cause either way you are asking for a STD.  After you get laid (if you do) go to a clinic and get checked out. Some STDs can live in your body for as many as 15 yrs without any symptoms.  Some clinics test for little or no money and it is worth knowing."
8,"Think about where his interests lie, then look into unique gifts in that area.  For example, if he loves hunting, maybe you could find an antique hunting rifle or a painting of a hunting scene.  If he likes fast cars, then you could get him a scale model of his favorite car.  Sports, get him some sports memorabilia from his favorite player, etc. etc.  \n\nOf course, sexual favors are always appreciated. You could even make a little booklet of ""coupons"" he can redeem throughout the year as he chooses."
8,because we are not boys and men! lol.....
8,anything u have in common :)
8,I think that is shallow...picking between the two based on looks.... but who are you more attracted to. This is a personal preference decision. Who treats you the way you want to be treated...in ALL ways!

8,"A certain amount is necessary.  When I was first married we struggled to make ends meet.  We're married 12 1/2 years now and we're in a much better financial place.  I don't have to worry about how to pay the car insurance with takes away alot of the stress.  However, I was very happy then just as I am happy now.  Money is a facilitator, but by itself won't make you happy."
8,"I'm sorry you lost your father in such a tragic way. You never get over it, you just learn how to deal with it. I would go to a bereavement therapist or I would join a bereavement group in your area. It sounds like you have a lot of pain and you really need to vent instead of holding it all inside. May God bless you and may you find comfort in this hard time. Don't feel because it was 16 years ago, that you shouldn't grieve."
8,"he was upset at u , he probably could have thought that u were just passing your time with him, not because u were interestedin him , because u had nothing better to do...maybe u should try telling him that u didn't mean it........"

8,i thin kyou should move on. if he hasnt took the time to actually realize you havnt called him in three days and didnt  call you to ask about it then hes not worried about you. i think you should leave him alone. dont worry about him. hes an ass! and then that message he left you on myspace...that sucked a big one!!!!!
8,"Originally,a Minuteman was an infantryman during the Revolutionary War (for the colonies).

8,"nothing wrong with a glance. If he is drooling then there's a prob. Why do women not say anything when he glances at a guy? There is a fine line between glancing and staring. It is also a natural tendency to be aware of your surroundings. Hey, that chick might have a gun! Only insecure women get upset with this. If you are secure with your man then you will only smile and be happy he is with you."
8,"i don't know why a lot of guys are so obsessed with sex.    i joke around a lot acting like i want it but i'm just playing around and she knows it.  i wait for her to make the first move letting me know that she wants it before i act back.  to me, sex is a way to express your love to your partner.  sex should not be used only for pleasure."
8,blue films? they are pros think about something else during playtime
8,"a person with schizophrenia, really does believe what is in their minds. and don't worry about the spelling cause some others have gotten in wrong too, they are just being a smart a*s. but truly with someone like this it is best to just listen to what they say, and never try to convince them that what they are telling you is wrong, it will not work and could possibly be a dangerous situation if you did. Just be a good listener if you can, and if not...just cut all ties with that person if need be.(i learned alot about this in my abnormal psychology class for college). good luck!!"
8,"I think it's possible to feel something very close to true love without actually meeting, but I think you can't know if it is real true love until you meet physically - for me the whole chemical thing is just huge, if I don't like how a guy smells, he has no chance. And there are so many aspects of our personalities that only come out face to face.\n\nThat said - I exchanged emails with my current bf for about a month before we actually met, and I was definitely well on my way towards falling in love before we met - which made a big difference, because I don't know if I would have been so attracted to him physically if I hadn't already fallen for him mentally."
8,"Your wife is in denial about her bear-like appearance. She is angry with herself for failing to live up to her number one responsibility: being sexually desireable to her husband. She would rather think it is the goat that has come between you than admit to herself that she has failed. My advice is: talk to your wife. Explain to her that you are still willing to support her and your children, but that you are no longer sexually attracted to her, and must fulfill your manly needs with your new goat. Maybe the shame of the whole situation will motivate her to jog in the mornings."
8,announcing your pregnant
8,The best way to find true love is not to look at all. Let her come to you. Go out make a few girl friends and hopefully the right one will come to you. Good luck!
8,Yes you can lose your heart on your best friend. But sometimes it works out and other times it doesen't. To me I wouldn't do it cause it will be hard to get that friendship back the way it was before. Example is Dawson and Joey. Remember she didn't choose her best friend in the end.
8,"You are not married. Don't feel as tied down as you currently do. I think you guys need a timeout. Stay away from each other for any time between 2 weeks to a month. See how you feel about him then. Take some time to reflect on your thoughts. But state clearly to him that you guys will not see other people during this time period. It's only a timeout. You just need some time to get your thoughts together. Also, you guys have been together for 2 years. I think you will find a way to work out this issue. Best of luck."
8,"I would ask, he may not be honest but he'll know you know....that will make him very nervous. but you definitly want to ask,,not attack, cause if he isn't then you'll create a bigger problem by accusing him of something he isn't doing."
8,Andy Tutle from the Gedney Pickle family. Thanks dude!
8,i like it everywhere specially in my mouth and all over my breast and face i got w*t by thinking about it i need to call my fiance for a lunch f**k
8,"yes, grow up.  I would guess you are around 14-17.  This is not uncommon to get this feeling.  I've been there, you will be there again.  The girl you meet that makes you feel good to be you and doesn't give you reason to worry, is the girl you want.  Don't settle for less.  There are a lot of unstable girls out there.  But remember, your young, girls at this age are just growing up too.  Don't be too hard on them."
8,Possible?  Yes.  Likely?  No.
8,"He may be feeling like these are his last days of ""freedom"" and the ability to come and go as he pleases.  You can't make him stay home with you, he'll only wind up resenting the situation.  All you can do is tell him honestly what your needs are and that even though the baby has not arrived yet, his presence with you helps you feel secure and less anxious of the future.  A guys night out even once a week or so is not bad.  But if he's out all of the time, you need to find out why he is reluctant to spend this quality time together.  Also, can you compromise by the two of you going out together sometimes?\n\neditted to add:\nAnd dear lord, do not let people tell you that pregnant women can not be sexy or that you are used goods.  You have a precious life growing inside and any real man would recognize that for the miracle that it is.  A less confident man may not.  Also, I got pg out of wedlock.  I am now happily (usually, lol) married with 2 beautiful children and even if the future would change with my husband, I would never ever regret the experience because I have the 2 greatest joys of my heart sleeping upstairs from me."
8,"Definitely if they have a good personality. :)\n\nSkin color doesn't matter. Like in my eyes it looks really weird when a blonde girl goes and tans all the time. It's very unnatural looking to me.

9,"You are horribly uneducated.  If you call increasing our national debt by billions of dollars per year being economically sound, what happens when the bottom falls out.  I would hardly call this economy booming.  You also fail to mention that Bill Clinton operated with a budget surplus while Bush operates with a huge deficit.  This may be because of the war, but the war was Bush's main cause.  Oh andby the way how is that war coming along.  There is nor end in site and it could be decades before we are able to withdraw.  When Clinton dealt with Iraq he did it with surgical precision and took care of the situation in Iraq without having any type of extended conflict.  The main difference is that the rest of the world repected Clinton, but no one respects Bush.  You also fail to mention that since our commander in chief took power, not one, but two countries have began enriched uranium programs.  In case you don't know what that means, it means they have the power to make nuclear weapons.  One leader directly said they did it because of our president's attitude toward him.  That is good leadership.  Also, since NAFTA there has been a net increase in American jobs, my college international business teacher stresses that fact all the time.  So while we have lost low paying jobs we havce gained even more higher paying jobs.  Look it up, it is a fact.  Clinton did not fire those workers.  Poor business management fired those workers.  They were fired because they were overpayed by incompetent bosses.  Don't blame a president for that.  And you can thank Bill Clinton for the lower prices you enjoy because of NAFTA.  So good question, actually it is not a good question because you are comparing apples to oranges and your facts are wrong.  Congratulations.\nP.S. and G.W. wants to cut educational spendning, so if you want to go to college someday, he wants to make sure you have to pay more.\nP.P.S. and your wonderfol president wants it to be legal to essentially ""spy"" on you and every other citizen."

These immigrants are the ones willing to do our ""dirty"" work (janitors, farmers, grape-pickers, etc.).

A date is set for am adjudicatory hearing (trial) within 30 days of the petition!\n\nCPS is required to look at a relative placement. Depending on what they find, that may not happen. That as well has to be explained to the court.\n\nRelative placements are no panacea, especially in cases of sexual abuse. Stidies have found  relative placements tend to make reunification longer and the person's required to complete cerrtain tasks, like counseling and parenting skills training, are less likely to do them!\n\nI suspect you know why your children were taken.\n\nBlaming CPS without telling us why is just an attack on cps to make them look bad!\n\nWhy don't you tell us the real reason?\n\nIf you really want help Email me!"

9,"That isn't how statutes of limitations work.  Statutes of limitations are designed to prevent lawsuits from being brought too long after the alleged wrong has occurred.  For example, if someone assaults you, you can't sue them 20 years later, you have to sue them within the time limit established by the statute of limitations, which varies from state to state.  As you've already initiated a case and seem to have won, the statute of limitations doesn't apply.  \n\nI think what you're asking is if there's a statutorily defined time by which any monies you win in court must be paid by.  The answer is ""Probably not"", but the losing party will of course be bound to abide by whatever payment schedule is ordered by the court.  You can assume that the court order on this subject is going to comply with the law.  Judges aren't dumb.\n\nIf you're looking to get that money faster, there are companies out there that will buy that equity from you for a smaller lump sum up front.  I don't recommend it, as you wind up with less money than you would if you just waited it out, but you can get the money faster that way."

9,"The city is required to present evidence that the defendant was in violation of the city ordinance prior to the defendant presenting any evidence.\n\nThe city will call their first witness and will ask questions necessary to bring out all the facts the witness has knowledge of concerning the case.  After the city attorney has asked questions, the defendant will have a right to cross-examine the witness.  During cross-examination, the defendant may not testify or argue with the witness.  At that time the defendant may only ask questions to elicit answers from the witness.  The defendant may only ask for information which deals with the issues of the violation of the ordinance.  After the defendant has completed his examination and the city has completed its examination of the first witness, the city will call their next witness.  The same procedure as to examination is followed with all of the witnesses called by the city.\n\nAfter the city has called all their witnesses they will rest their case.  At that time the defendant has a right to present evidence.  He may call witnesses and if so, he will examine them first and the city attorney will have the right to cross-examine them after the defendant's examination.  During the defendant's examination of the witness, his questions need to be stated in such a way that the witness will give the facts in his answer.\n\nThe defendant may also testify although he is not required to do so and it will not be held against him if he decides not to testify.  If the defendant testifies, he will tell what happened in his own words.  The city attorney will have the right to cross examine him and he is required to answer the city attorney's questions.\n\nAfter the defendant has completed his case and the city has completed their case, the court will make a decision.  If the defendant is found not guilty, the case is over and the defendant's appearance bond will be refunded.  If the defendant is found guilty, the court will assess punishment not to exceed the maximum authorized under the city ordinance plus court costs.If the defendant is found guilty, he has a right to appeal and receive a new trial.  In order to appeal, the defendant must post an appeal bond as set by the court.  The defendant will then have a new trial before a district judge who will make a determination of his innocence or guilt.  In a new trial the judge will make a finding on what is presented and is not bound by any finding of the Municipal Court.  If the defendant is found innocent, his appeal bond will be refunded and the case is over.  If the defendant is found guilty, the district judge will set the fine and costs.  The amount of fine and costs may be more or may be less than what the Municipal Court imposes.  From a finding of guilty in the second trial, the defendant has a right to appeal on the record to the Court of Criminal Appeals. you speaking will help put that rapist away for good! i wish you luck!"

Do what ever it takes to get your education. My mom would never get on welfare or housing assistant, so we had to stay in this house with no running hot water and efficent heat for over half my life. Why? I don't know and I didn't think it was fair on us (the kids) to have to suffer like that. SO for the sake of your child, get as much assistant possible. When you get that degree your child will have better respect for you.\nRemember Welfare is for people who stumble and need help, so get the help you need. And don't worry about what everybody else say. I'm sure there are some rich people in New Orleans that lost everything, and had to get some kind of assistant. I wonder how they felt to humble themselves. Its hard but remember its their to help. Not to be taken advantage of."

9,"While EVERYONE will say Clinton (there's a strong wave of anti-Bush-ism) both have their flaws.\n\nCLINTON -\nDid nothing over terrorist attacks on America.\n -The WTC was bombed before Sep. 11. \n -U.S. Embasies were bombed\n -The USS Cole was bombed   (all by Bin Laden)\n\nCommited Purgery (a very impeachable offense)\n\nBUSH -\n -Went overboard on 'war on terror' in attacking Iraq. (opinion)\n -Economy has been down for quite some time\n -Is much less liked internationally (and domestically too)\n\nThey've both done good things, I think too.\n\nCLINTON -\n   -Economy flurished\n   -US well respected in world\n\nBUSH -\n   -Willing to do what it takes to keep America safe. (By attacking Afghanistan, something Clinton wouldn't do with previous attacks.)\n   -Has GREATLY increased free trade in the western hemisphere (although there are some farmers in Mexico and other S.American places that say free trade hurts them.)\n\nOverall, I think that both presidents did the best they could and that their actions (especially Bush's) are more of a response to circumstances outside their control.  I don't think, for example, (and many do) that Bush intended to go to war when he was elected.  I don't think that Clinton thought he was lying. (I think he thought he used clever words to hide what he actually did.  He used the word 'sexual relations' which he interpreted to mean 'sexual intercorce' and he only had oral sex.)\n\nSo either way, I don't think that either president has really hurt or help America in any appreciable way. (that the other wouldn't have.)"

9,"If you signed a lease (a written agreement) then for instance your the landlord and someone is renting from you then you have to give them a notice, then if they don't want to leave, then you take the matter to the magistrate, then wait some more (about 30 more days). Roughly, it will take 90 days and then the magistrate will send (more than likely)a Constable to escort the people out (or you if this is the case). The matter will be brought up at the magistrate level carrying a fine and the amount due in rent. If your on probation or something this shouldn't cause an uproar with your P.O. its not like its a new charge and then you would get violated. As far as your credit like I said if your paying on it (making an effort) then you shouldn't worry. But with everything else your credit is effected.

9,"Oh-boy what a barrel of political snakes that is.  We have a State/Federal  government system that is failing by leaps and bounds (Katrina anyone?) They have proved their ineffectiveness in so many issues of “public service” that the best the limpwrist legislators can do is to continue to INCREASE TAXES and make more laws to band-aid the previous failures.  In 1950 we had about 10,000 federal laws. As the need for more government control escalated and in the name of a better life for U.S. citizens, by 2004 there were over 150,000 laws (within the USC and CFR alone).  The states have followed suit, increasing laws on the books by a factor of 10, but in the final analysis, the laws can ALL be reduced down to one common denominator: Making it easier for the government to control the people. VERY few of theses laws have increased independence, choice, or free will of the individual.\nThe evolution of police forces under this system have gone from “Protect and Serve” painted on the side of police cars, to the new and improved “Law Enforcement” …  and with that, summary execution of about one unarmed local suspect a week (Portland Oregon area as a classic example) for failing to follow instructions, none of the involved  “officers” ever indicted by grand juries after the fact.

I'm pro-choice, but I understand the moral dilemma abortion raises.  \n\nThe real problem is that both liberals and conservatives have used their political positions as a way to react to issues in knee-jerk brainless types of ways.  We need to stop seeing the world through the lens of conservative and liberal and instead start trying to construct genuine solutions to the problems of our world.

9,"Oh, you BET! I, for one, cannot wait until we discover life on other planets and have our first intergalactic (real!) Miss Universe Pageant.\n\nBut, of course, we will have to iron out all kinds of little details. For example, will we let in the Unigendres of the planet Farflungus, who can't tell if they are male or female? They have no gender honorifics like Miss or Mister, so will their customs and laws allow one of them to be called MISS Universe or will we be forced to adopt their own designation of ""Mrmph"" Universe, as they do?\n\nAnd what about standards of beauty? How do we codify and standardize what looks good in a swimsuit when the Orkas of Planet Pondos think that the minimum standard of pulchritude is to possess a body mass approaching that of a large, well-fed African Elephant? Or what about the Freepliks of Planet Borborygmia, who think that nothing is so pretty as a female with long flowing tentacles oozing slime from every greenish-grey pore? \n\n\nThen there is where to have the pageant, the nearest neighbor Alpha Centauri being a mere 12 light years away, and of course the music and entertainment will be up for discussion. For example, the Bork of Maladicta think music is torture and employ it on their most hardened criminals and we have to say, having heard Borkian tunes, we quite agree with them. Or what about the Yikes of Vlistipore, who believe dancing and singing are sinful and wrong, but find nuclear detonations to be quite entertaining, to the point that they've obliterated three of their solar system's own planets and are currently in the market for a fourth.

(Nearly half of all illegal aliens currently living in the U.S. came here since Bush became president in 2000.) \n\nMexican American Legal Defense Fund founder Mario Obledo stated, “California is going to be a Hispanic state.

The current borders of the United States will be extinguished.\n\nThe Council of La Raza succeeded in having itself added to congressional hearings by Republican House and Senate leaders.

They are billed by Bush as temporary, but the Senate is saying they (the ones yet to come under an increase in legal immigration rate) can become permanent residents with a path to citizenship.

9,"I think that Iraq was on Mr. Bush's mind the day he took office.  On day one he put a target on Saddam's head and was ready to use any excuse to finish his daddy's job.\n\nHis father, however, knew the consequeces of a march on Bahgdad.  That is why we stopped short of Saddam in 91, we had a clean victory and Sr. quit while he was ahead.\n\nJr., however, wanted blood.  He was convinced that Saddam would one day become the next great tyrant.  Like Johnson in 64, Bush was ready to pounce at the first sign of any agression.  The perfect reason to declare open-ended war fell into his lap on an early september monday morning.\n\nIt has been reported that just hours after the planes hit Bush was heard asking his advisors if Iraq was involved.  He was asking very leading questions of his advisors, including donald rumsfeld, who both wanted to pin 9/11 on Saddam before the towers even hit the ground.\n\nBut some would say they were smart, they went for the easy win first.  They needed to prove to the public that America could lead a successful nation-building war.  Of course I wouldn't call Afghanistan rebuilt when 95% of their economy is from the sale of opiates (I am against prohibition, but Bush isn't).  Even today, after the supposed elections and overthrow of the taliban, the only way an afghan woman can make any kind of living is to work in the opium fields.\n\nWe all saw the buildup for war.  He and his messengers (condie, rumsfeld, right wing puppet congressmen) had us all believing that we were about to be nuked.  The sad thing is that the public at large bought right into it.  I must say he even got me wondering just what Mr. Saddam had up his sleeve.  I suppose that's why I was rather exited to watch the war on tv, I just wanted to see what this guy had.  I watched the sabre rattling in the weeks leading up to 'shock and awe'.  It was entertaining to watch these two morons square off.  I thought Saddam would have had more of a back bone though.  I expected to see a tienemen square scecne in Bahgdad, but right away I could tell once we entered the capitol that something was wrong.\n\nIf Bush had been right, I have no doubt that Saddam would have used those weapons on American soldiers.  But they never existed.  Just like the second attack at the gulf of Tonkin.  It never happened.  LBJ however did not lie himself, rather his advisors lied to him.  True, Johnson was willing and ready to pounce should a tit-for-tat oppertunity present itself.  He believed the second attack on a stranded US cruiser was just such an oppertunity.  His advisors knew of his willingness to decalre war and fed him intel that would lead him in that direction.  LBJ wanted to look strong on defence and strong against communism going into a tough 1964 election.  He knew that he would be judged to the standard of 'what would JFK have done?' in the public eye.  Once he had blindly acceped the attack as truth and declared war, it wasn't long before the conflict spiraled out of his control.  ""For all I know, they're shooting at whales"" Johnson said the next year about the war that was now out of his control.\n\nThe rhetoric leading upto Iraq was different.  The intel was 'misread' by everyone in the aministration, so either everyone is lieing or everyone is that dumb.  I think they were seeing what they wanted to see.  As soon as any intel came accross that would give a glimmer of hope to uniting the country behind a war surfaced, they took it as fact because they wanted to.  It suited their political end.\n\nI believe that this intel was also pressured out of the cia and nsa from the white house.  Bush pushed so hard for 'actionable intel' that people eventually told him what he wanted to hear.  This still continues as they try to quell the uprising.  The president is so desperate for information on both insurgents and al-queida (sp?) that he is willing to turn his back on the rest of"

Are you surprised?  Ever smoke pot or drive fast or drink under age?  Guess what?  People do incredibly vile illegal things too!  What sets this apart from mainstream culture, however, is the expense of importing, hiding, and eliminating the slaves.  Let's think about who in America can afford such things... hmmm...  Who could it be?  Well, maybe this is what we get for our trickle down theories?  Maybe what's trickling down isn't something we'd like to get on our clothes.\n\nSo now we come to the Bush Administration... wealthy, connected, more than enough money to lie and get away with it...

The West were very worried after the Gulf war when he burned oil refineries and oil rigs cause millions of £££ worth of damage and loss of a massive amount of oil. What's stopping him from doing it again?\n\nSo by securing oil supply from the Middle East it has actually helped both the US, UK and Iraqi people as this provides the money to invest into their infrastructure and improve standard of living. \n\nUnfortunately this is completely wrong! unethical and embarrasing that we could represent a race of people so materialistic and selfish its about time we realised that we can not keep raping this planet's resources and we need to limit use of resources and pollution before we come to a very abrupt end.\n\nThe war in Iraq as absolutely nothing to do with ridding the Iraq people of a dictator, nobody could give a flying f-uck..  look at Africa! no one cares about the dictators and warlords that have done far FAR worse than Saddam, unfortunately they have no oil."

9,"""Can an employee seek an interlocutory injunction against his employer?  If an employee feels that his employer is unreasonably requiring him to do work which is not part of his contractual obligations, can he seek an interlocutory injunction against his employer to maintain the status quo at work?""\n\nThe quick answer to your question is ""Yes, you can seek just about anything before a court of competent jurisdiction.""\n\nThe real question would be is it actionable?  And, assuming you have an actual contract (not a ""job description"") then you could file for breech of contract or injunctive relief for non-performance, etc. if the provisions of the contract allow AND if you have actually suffered some damages for which you are entitled relief.  That said, most employment contracts provide some specificity on the issue.  \n\nCheck your contract.  And realize that employment relationships generally necessitate some form of consistent give and take.  What is very unlikely is that a court would issue an order to your employer about how to conduct that relationship pending some final adjudication over the damages you claim.  If it isn't what you signed up for, terminate the relationship and take whatever liquidated damages (or ""Golden parachute"" or the like) are provided for in your employment contract.\n\n[This is not legal advice.

9,"Although the stimulant and hunger-suppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries, the isolation of the cocaine alkaloid was not achieved until 1855. Many scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time, worsened because coca does not grow in Europe and ruins easily during travel.\n\nThe cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Gaedcke in 1855. Gaedcke named the alkaloid “erythroxyline,” and published a description in the journal Archives de Pharmacie.\n\nIn 1856, Friedrich Wöhler asked Dr. Carl Scherzer, a scientist aboard the Novara (an Austrian frigate sent by Emperor Franz Joseph to circle the globe), to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from South America. In 1859, the ship finished its travels and Wöhler received a trunk full of coca. Wöhler passed on the leaves to Albert Niemann, a Ph.D. student at the University of Göttingen in Germany, who then developed an improved purification process.\n\nNiemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his dissertation titled Über eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern (On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves), which was published in 1860—it earned him his Ph. D. and is now in the British Library. He wrote of the alkaloid's “colourless transparent prisms” and said that, “Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.” Niemann named the alkaloid “Cocain”—as with other alkaloids its name carried the “-in” ending (derived from the Latin suffix -ina)."

Then imagine that on a larger scale throughout the country.

MIT Department of Economics Working Paper No. 02-22.\n\n""We find that greater female labor supply: (1) Leads to lower female wages; a 10 percent increase in female employment reduces female earnings by 7 to 11 percent; (2) Leads to lower male wages; a 10 percent increase in female employment reduces male earnings by 4 to 6 percent; (3) Increases the college premium and wage inequality among males generally. Our findings suggest that in the aftermath of WWII, women were closer substitutes to high school graduate and relatively low-skill males, but not to those with less than high school and the lowest skills."""

9,"First, you can't just decide to go on reserve.  Once your active enlistment is up, you can then enlist to serve in the reserves.  Reserve pay is dependent upon the number of drills you take part in.  If you are making 30k a year, you would have to be at least the rank of Sergeant (E-5) and have spent 8 years or more in the service. The same grade and time in service would net you about $330 for a weekend's worth of drill before taxes."

Is there not one liberal who can actually give an intelligent answer - not just repeating Micheal Moore?  \nHave you ever heard of Economics?  Do you not understand that SUPPLY & DEMAND drive economics?  The high oil prices are pretty easy to understand if are open minded.\nCrude oil prices are set by OPEC (that's ORGANIZATION for PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES).  China & India are demanding double the oil they once needed because of their rapidly growing middle classes.  The worldwide demand has gone up and the worldwide supply has not increased.  When you have more demand than supply then the crude oil price will go up.  If we had more supply than demand the price would go down.  It's pretty simple an't it!  OPEC controls part of the prices, refining crude oil is the other cost.  Since we have not built any refineries or explored for oil in the past 30 years because of enviromental wackos - that is contributing to the high gas prices."

9,"Occurrence:\n\nMost popular press articles suggest a link between the winter holidays and suicides (Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania 2003). However, this claim is just a myth. In fact, suicide rates in the United States are lowest in the winter and highest in the spring (CDC 1985, McCleary et al. 1991, Warren et al. 1983). \nSuicide took the lives of 30,622 people in 2001 (CDC 2004). \nSuicide rates are generally higher than the national average in the western states and lower in the eastern and midwestern states (CDC 1997). \nIn 2002, 132,353 individuals were hospitalized following suicide attempts; 116,639 were treated in emergency departments and released (CDC 2004). \nIn 2001, 55% of suicides were committed with a firearm (Anderson and Smith 2003).\n  \nGroups At Risk:\n\nMales\n\nSuicide is the eighth leading cause of death for all U.S. men (Anderson and Smith 2003). \nMales are four times more likely to die from suicide than females (CDC 2004). \nSuicide rates are highest among Whites and second highest among American Indian and Native Alaskan men (CDC 2004). \nOf the 24,672 suicide deaths reported among men in 2001, 60% involved the use of a firearm (Anderson and Smith 2003). \n\nFemales\n\nWomen report attempting suicide during their lifetime about three times as often as men (Krug et al. 2002). \nYouth\nThe overall rate of suicide among youth has declined slowly since 1992 (Lubell, Swahn, Crosby, and Kegler 2004). However, rates remain unacceptably high. Adolescents and young adults often experience stress, confusion, and depression from situations occurring in their families, schools, and communities. Such feelings can overwhelm young people and lead them to consider suicide as a “solution.” Few schools and communities have suicide prevention plans that include screening, referral, and crisis intervention programs for youth.\n\nSuicide is the third leading cause of death among young people ages 15 to 24. In 2001, 3,971 suicides were reported in this group (Anderson and Smith 2003). \nOf the total number of suicides among ages 15 to 24 in 2001, 86% (n=3,409) were male and 14% (n=562) were female (Anderson and Smith 2003). \n\nAmerican Indian and Alaskan Natives have the highest rate of suicide in the 15 to 24 age group (CDC 2004). \nIn 2001, firearms were used in 54% of youth suicides (Anderson and Smith 2003).\n \nThe Elderly\n\nSuicide rates increase with age and are very high among those 65 years and older. Most elderly suicide victims are seen by their primary care provider a few weeks prior to their suicide attempt and diagnosed with their first episode of mild to moderate depression (DHHS 1999). Older adults who are suicidal are also more likely to be suffering from physical illnesses and be divorced or widowed (DHHS 1999; Carney et al. 1994; Dorpat et al. 1968).\n\nIn 2001, 5,393 Americans over age 65 committed suicide. Of those, 85% (n=4,589) were men and 15% (n=804) were women (CDC 2004). \nFirearms were used in 73% of suicides committed by adults over the age of 65 in 2001 (CDC 2004). \n \nRisk Factors:\n\nThe first step in preventing suicide is to identify and understand the risk factors. A risk factor is anything that increases the likelihood that persons will harm themselves. However, risk factors are not necessarily causes. Research has identified the following risk factors for suicide (DHHS 1999):\n\nPrevious suicide attempt(s) \nHistory of mental disorders, particularly depression \nHistory of alcohol and substance abuse \nFamily history of suicide \nFamily history of child maltreatment \nFeelings of hopelessness \nImpulsive or aggressive tendencies \nBarriers to accessing mental health treatment \nLoss (relational, social, work, or financial) \nPhysical illness \nEasy access to lethal methods \nUnwillingness to seek help because of the stigma attached to mental health and substance abuse disorders or suicidal thoughts \nCultural and religious beliefs—for instance,"

9,Yes.  You should disclose it on your job application.
9,"no, it actually does the opposite by accentuating our high standard of living, but it is having an adverse affect on our own economy.  When there is high demand for a product (LCD TV let's say) in the US It drives the prices up, and up, and up, because of the minimum wage laws in the US.  This makes it more profitable for companies to outsource jobs to other countries, and then transport the goods back to the US.  Also, when prices go up people start to shop around for the best deal, and Chinese goods are much less costly, therefore China gets more business from Americans than America does.  If tariffs were to be placed on Chinese goods, then China would be less impactfull on the US economy, but our standard of living would decline because we could not afford to have the shiny new technology, and that would probably piss the Chinese off, which at this point in time we do not want (we have enough people pissed off at us).  Either way we will not be the top country for much longer...Unless we can get those crazy Arabs to give up religions; the biggest antagonistic factor in their hatred of America."

9,"For now the white female has the inside track.\n\nThe most obvious black male, Colin Powell, has decided that he will not run for President.  Presidents usually come from four sources.

Call when you can. Write and email as often as possible. Make sure they know there might be times when you can't call or email and not to worry. Tell them to stay busy. Good luck.
9,"Guaranteed, you will deploy to Iraq as SF.  You will mainly escort convoys, guard the base perimeter, and maybe do a sweep of a local area if necessary.  Everyone is being deployed so I really wouldn't worry about going, but the deployments are about 6 months at a time.  It is not as bad as people make it out to be, I have some friends in the Marines that are over there and they said that it's really not bad at all."

9,Whether Hillary Clinton will run or not is not relevent to Karl Rove's behavior towards her. Karl Rove should learn how to deal with others in a more civil manner and stop the personal attacks on Hillary Clinton until she at least announces her candidacy for the Presidency. If Hillary Clinton does run that is her right and I would hope that she does not resort to the kind of behavior the current administration is taking part in in attacking opponents. I do not think Hillary Clinton should run and would not vote for her but I do not think it appropriate for the Republican party to be conducting a smear campaign on a potential candidate. If they want to behave in such a manner they should at least wait to attack the actual candidates.

9,"When President George HW Bush was in office, it was a defensive war fought to liberate Kuwait from Iraq. The goal of the war was only the freedom of Kuwait, not to move into Iraq, although a number of US generals were pushing for it. Bush, Powell and other leaders decided it was not in the best interest to go in at that time - this wasn't an ""unfinished war"" despite what people want to say to demean the current President. The Kurds, thinking we were going to help them free themselves from Hussein, started an uprising. When we didn't come into Iraq, Hussein's army easily suppressed the rebellion and then proceeded to torture and kill entire villiages and towns, including through the use of WMDs (sarin gas), and then openly attempted to assassinate Bush after he was out of office.\n\nAs part of Hussein's surrender, they had to comply by UN laws and treaties. They did not for 12 years. Why would you fault Bush for taking a murderous dictator for task? And name one war that we ""got out right away?"" We still have troops stationed overseas from WWII, Korea and Vietnam. For some reason, Americans decided that wars can be fought during commercial breaks during sitcoms. Wars are drawn out processes that result in many lives lost, but for the hopefully greater good of society.\n\nGod bless your son, but don't trivalize what he is fighting for."
9,"The county clerk will have the details.  If it is a state measure, the secretary of state's office.  The details vary from one jurisdiction to another, but basically what you need to do is print up the exact wording of the proposition and circulate it for signatures.  The signatories must all be registered voters of the jurisdiction involved, and there is a minimum number of signatures to qualify for the ballot.  There will also be time deadlines for submitting them.  Be sure to get all this information before you start, because collecting the signatures will take time and organization.  You need to put a handful of the printed propositions, with lots of lines for people to sign, on a clip-board, make sure you have a supply of pens that work, and canvas anyone who is willing to stop and speak to you in shopping areas, public buildings, around bus or train stations, etc.  Then you need to collect about 10% more signatures than the law requires, because some people will forget and sign twice, and some will not be validly registered to vote.\n\nGood luck!  I hope your idea is worth all that.  Once it gets on the ballot, of course, you will still have a huge amount of work persuading voters to vote in favor of it."

9,"I think he's had the message for some time now.  Of course he doesn't care though.  He's doing what he thinks is right.  \n\nEven with Bush, there must be some unconscious part of him that knows the way the whole thing has happened has been a mistake.  You can tell by the way he's always trying to convince the public.  If it was right action, there would be no convincing.  He would just say what's happened, what decisions he's making, and he would just answer questions straightly.\n\nI have to say thanks to the American public for showing the rest of the world that it's not just non-Americans that can't stand what's been happening in Iraq.\n\nAs for the president, I think he'll stick with his story til his dying day.

9,"I am against illegal immigration and think we need to stop it. I think we need strong border security and enforceable penalties for the employers. If I had that, except for the gang/nasties, though, I'd legalize those here but NOT allow an additional preference to bring in family.  Family would have to come in under existing quotas. Partly I'd do this because we did let these folks get unreasonably settled, and partly I just couldn't face the kind of human tragedy that I am sure would result with mass deportations.  And yes, I think the adults amongst them bought it.  But even so...\n\nHowever, total numbers are key.  I would kill any forward increase in immigration until the border were secure and employer databases were up so that employer sanctions could be enforced. Even then I would want the employers of the new guest workers to pay impact fees for local schools and health care, and would want the numbers of all (including dependents) to be carefully thought through in terms of how they would impact education and health care for our own citizens."

The lawyers who work for and the people who support the ACLU really should look at themselves and ask, ""isn't the fact that I am against religion (which in its best form, molds family values and keeps kids from being raised in broken homes, etc.), make me participant to the destruction of the very thing I am trying to protect (the well-being of the average person).  It is actually leading to the deterioration of our values as a society instead of contributing to them.  Don't be fooled... unless you are trash in society, you will never need their help.

9,"I work for a personal injury firm. When you get into an accident, it doesn't only depend on how much of your medical bills are. It depends on how injured you are. Just because you were in an accident doesn't mean that you will get compensated b/c of your medical bills. You must prove significant injury. But based on your 100K in bills so far, it seems pretty serious. So I wouldn't worry about. \n\nHowever, you can't get more money than what the policy has. You have a lawyer right? They will file a suit for you. What you should tell him is the file the suit now because your case will take a long time to settle if you don't. \n\nAlso the only way you can get more money from the accident, is if (a) you have an underinsured motorist policy that exceeds that amount (which you can get the difference, if it settles for their entire policy) or (b) they have an umbrella policy (that's a homeowners policy which could be in the millions, but if their not homeowners then theres no policy); \n\nAnother thing you have to check is when they told you its a 500K policy, is it a single combined limit? (that means all injured parties will have to share the 500K in the policy, no matter how many were injured or their injuries) or is it a 250/500 policy? because that means that the most you can get as an individual is $250,000 only. It's basically $250K per person/$500 per accident. So you should find out because if you weren't the only one injured, then you'll be looking at the funds being split amongst the injured parties. \n\nWhen you sue, you are basically suing for pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment of life. Those are thing s you must prove. Psychologist, can prove emotional distress. Enjoyment of life? like not being able to workout, go dancing, have intimite relations with your significant other. Those are thing s you must prove, especially if it goes to court. \n\nGood luck."
9,"Oh well they also claim that Palestinians are not people and therefor have no right to the land. \n No I would not be willing to give up my land.

I am not saying the UN was right to create Israel out of someone eles land, but it would have solved alot of problems.\n Oh no don't get me wrong I completely sympathize with the Palestinian people. Israeli soldiers cross into Palestinian land and kidnap their government leaders and put them in jail claiming they are terrorists. No No No not for one second do I believe Israel to be in the right. \n I just think given the way the world works Palestine should have accepted a compromise, Im not sure if that would have even mattered since the Zionist regime in Israel has stated that they will not be happy until they control the entire middle east."

Britains colonial regiments were fighting regiments and when they did join the war they fought gallantly and to say that they were there to dig holes for the whites is disingenous.\n\nSimilarly the French Morrocan regiments fought with great gallantry at Verdun.\n\nA good place to visit is Vimy Ridge in France where the Canadians faced up against the Germans. It was preserved as a living memorial to the trench war and has perfectly preserved trenches, tunnels and shell holes in the woodland as they were nearly a century ago.\n\nThe French government made it a part of Canada as a thankyou after the first world war, and even Hitler decreed that it should remain so after Frances surrender in 1940.\n\nThe most amzing thing was how close the two front lines were, and to imagine two great armies sitting opposite each other for 4 years killing up to 200,000 men per day in set piece battles is very thought provoking."

9,"It is about polititions play God on another issue to get or more likely keep votes. If you ask them why they will talk circles about protecting us from ourselves. The truth is the polititions are protecting the pharmisudical companies. If marijuana was regulated and sold leagaly it would it would put the smuggelers out of business and help to keep it from the younger kids that should be protected. I personaly know hundreds of people who have been smoking pot for 25-35 years. They go to work every day, pay there taxes and are better citizens than many of the people who preach against letting people live their own lives. As far as pot being a gateway drug, it is only a gateway drug because it is illeagal. People smoke a little and they like it or not, if they like it they start loosing respect for our laws because they realize everything they have been told is a lie. Law and order should not be based on lies!  I do agree that driving and smoking is bad. But given a choice I would much rather be on the road with a hundred stoners than one drunk. If all of the government money wasted on enforcing marijuana laws was put into fighting the dangerous drugs the DEA might actually make a positive difference in drug use. In the mean time you have millions of people in this country with a lower respect for the law and find it difficult to get and keep a job because of smoking a joint after work. So the holyer than thou polititions and their supporters have us by the short hairs and will not give up their veiws because they want everyone to live the way they want us to live.

9,"WHIRLWIND VICTORIES\nWorld War Two began on September 1, 1939 when the German Army, along with Slovakia and the Soviet Union, invaded Poland. They captured Warsaw, the Polish capital, on September 27. The Polish Army offered some resistance, but German blitzkrieg tactics overwhelmed them. Panzer tanks and Stuka dive bombers quickly mowed down Polish infantry and cavalry regiments. However, the Armia Krajowa, known as the Polish Home Army, fought on until the end of the war.\n\nThe Axis Powers then attacked neutral Scandinavia on April 8, 1940. Giving little resistance, Allied troops withdrew from the area because of disasters in France (although commandos from the Norwegian underground still fought the Germans).\n\n\nTHE FALL OF FRANCE  May 10, 1940\nDuring the 1930s, the French concentrated their military budget on the Maginot Line, a series of fortifications on the border with Germany. Even though they had the most formidable army at the time, the French hoped for a static, defensive war. The Maginot Wall had massive guns pointing towards Germany, but the Germans crossed the Ardennes Forest and the Meuse River and later attacked the wall from behind. Dive bombers offered arial artillery while the panzers stormed the Allied position. The BEF (British Expeditionary Force) and the French troops had to evacuate from the port of Dunkirk. The BEF lost most of its equipment because there weren't enough ships, and most of the French Army had to stay back to defend their homeland.\n\nA collaborationist to the Germans, Philippe Petain ruled the country from Vichy, and his government was known as Vichy France. The remains of the once mighty French Army fought on as the Free French.\n\n\nBRITAIN STANDS ALONE  July, 1940\nUnder the leadership of Winston Churchill, Great Britain resisted against the Germans. The Germans hoped that after the fall of France, Britain would surrender, but the British were defiant. On July 1940, Hitler launched Operation Eagle, a plan to invade Britain. \n\nAfter initial skirmishes in the English Channel between land based Luftwaffe aircraft (the Kriegsmarine didn't have large aircraft carriers) and RAF Spitfires, the Germans went on to bomb London. This failed greatly because of the new British invention: radar. Whenever radar stations pick up signs of German aircraft fleets, Supermarine Spitfires took out the escorts and Hurricane fighters shot down the bombers. Churchill called it ""their finest hour.""\n\nBy the end if May, 1941, all German aircraft were withdrawn for the invasion of Russia.\n\n\nNAVAL WARFARE  1941-1943\nI. THE BISMARCK\nThe super battleship Bismarck was the war's largest warship.\nWeighing 41,700 tons, it had 8x380mm, 12x150mm, 6x105mm, 16x37mm, and 20x20mm guns. It also carried 4 aircraft. Commisioned on August 24, 1940, it sunk the pride of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood. The Bismarck itself was sunk on May 27, 1941.\n\nThe battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prince Eugen were spotted by a British recon craft and were tracked down to an area near Greenland. Bismarck separated from Prince Eugen to head for France. The Royal Navy then gave chase, sending in Swordfish biplanes and weakening the ship. HMS Ark Royal scored a hit and crippled the Bismarck. The battleship, being cornered by the ships Rodney and King George V, was finally sunk by HMS Dorsetshire.\n\nII. BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC\nAfter the fall of France, Admiral Karl Donitz operated his Unterseeboots in the Atlantic coast. He used ""wolf packs"" to sink down Allied shipping. The British replied with using the convoy formation, in which two light cruisers flank a merchant ship and a destroyer defends the ship's fore. The Allies also used sonar to locate German U-boats. The U-boats sank 260,000 tons of Allied shipping, when suddenly the tides turned. Long-range B-24 Liberator bombers and the use of escort carriers--light warships that can provide their own air cover--mounted heavy losses on the "

9,"Typically, if you're taking a job that's going to require you to fire these weapons, you'll be working in a tactical atmosphere.  \n\nFirst, the shot gun should be placed with it's butt firmly placed against your shoulder, with your off hand on the pump (if there is not a pump, then under the barrel on the portion that is guarded from the barrel) with your dominant hand around the neck behind the receiver (between the 'chamber' and 'butt')  Now spread your legs apart to just short of shoulder's width apart, and you should be able to fire comfortably, using your off hand to work the pump of the shotgun effortlessly.\n\nThe M16 Carbine is fired similarly, with the butt against your dominant side's shoulder firmly.  There are many options to hold the forend of the carbine, so whatever's comfortable with you, go with it.  In a tactical situation, you should place your off hand at the close end to the forend and where the weapon's magazine meet.  Then square away your shoulders so you present your chest flatly to where ever you're shooting.  This is so that if you're wearing body armor, you maximize being shot in the body armor directly, lessening the chance of a fatal hit to the sides, where the armor is weaker.  With your dominant hand, grip the pistol grip of the carbine.  \n\nAlways make sure that your finger stays off of the trigger until you are absolutely ready to fire.  And never aim at anything you do not fully intend to destroy.  \n\nGood luck."

9,"Mainstream politicians can't come out in favor of legalization, because they would never get elected/re-elected.  The libertarians have the advantage of not REALLY having to worry about saying things that will tank their ability to get elected, because they won't get elected anyway.  \n\nIt is another issue where politicians can't be truthful or use concrete data to make decisions because the American people don't see the nuances in arguments.  Politicians can't be in favor of mj decriminalization, because then the tv ads of their opponents will say they are for the legalization of drugs with a visual of someone shooting up.  \n\nThe founding fathers were right.  America can't handle a true, one person, one vote democracy.  It would require too much time and thought for most people to develop a good understanding of the issues.

9,"I am a republican, and make less than 80K a year. I used to make more, but 9-11 happened and my dream job ceased to exist. However, I became a republican because the platform of the party more closely reflected my personal, professional and political beliefs. I NEVER vote a straight party ticket, and always try to vote for the candidate I feel is the most qualified. In order to determine the qualifications of each candidate, I visit their websites, listen to political ads, watch debates and read profiles in the local paper. I try to be as informed about each candidate and their political stance on each issue before I determine whom to vote for. I have voted for democrats several times including in two presidential elections (Clinton).\n\nI regularly write my senators and representatives, both at state and federal level, in order to express my approval or disgust over their actions. I then vote my approval or dissatisfaction during the election. Most recently, I helped vote a republican mayor out of office because he was out of touch with the local citizens and was no longer a benefit to the community.\n\nI do not understand why you feel it is appropriate to take a fatalistic view of the world and decide certain ""things are never going to end."" I believe things can change if people want them to, particularly if a large group of people make a collective statement.\n\nI do not know anyone personally who advocates the eradication of wholesale segments of the population because of religious or sexual preference. \n\nI support proportional tax rates, to a point. No one should have to pay 80% on capital gains. There would be no incentive to earn money. Why would anyone invest $1 only to receive an additional 20 cents, regardless of how hard it was to make the 2nd dollar? You would bring the capitalist system to a halt.\n\nRepublicans normally support sound fiscal policy and the elimination or reduction of taxes. This is not always the case, as evidenced by some of the current administration's actions. You can't decry social inequity and then ask those who are the most industrious members of society to accept a system that forces them to work harder for less money because you want to give their hard earned money to people who aren't willing to work as hard."

9,"Most people believe that the Confederate Flag (more correctly known as the Confederate Battle Flag) is a symbol of hatred and division. They have been taught that the Civil War was fought because of slavery, and they feel that everyone who fought for the Confederacy were slave owners and believed in slavery.\n\nThere are others who are using this misconception for their own political agenda, and to CAUSE the hatred and division that they are screaming about. By maintaining this hatred, and racial tension, they gain and keep hold of the public's attneion, and the fame and power that comes with it. It is very much like the Whitre Supremist groups that spot false ""evidence"" in order to maintain their power in the public eye. Without the hatred and TV cameras that they need to spread their falsehoods, they just become another worthless, faceless person in the crowd.\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is this: 98% of the people who fought in the gray uniforms had never seen a slave before. Slave owners were usually rich, and it has almost always been the middle income and the poor who have populated the world's military services. They couldn't have cared one way or another if another rich boy had a few slves or not... it didn't affect his life in the very least.\n\nFinally, the Civil War was fought for a few reasons, the main one being the issue of State's Rights. The Confederate States believed that each state knew more what its citizenry needed and wanted than some faceless beauracrat in some city so far removed from them that they didn't know anything about them. The Confederate States believed in a weak centralized government and that the states had more rights than that centralized government. THAT is what the majority of the boys in gray were fighting for. \n\nThe Confederate Flag is very simply the flag they took into battle, and means nothing more than the UNion Jack, or the Maple Leaf, or the Rising Sun."

9,"I do not agree with this guy^^^^^yeah they might have been doing all these great things but you have to remember that in those times, mostly all women stayed home and took care of their children while their husbands went to work. Nowadays most women work all day...because a lot of them choose to..to have more money...so if all these women start working the income goes up in a home...the prices for living go up and it's a never ending circle......most of them have NO time to come home, being tired, and clean houses which is usually populated with 2 or more children. So they go and hire a nanny.....and not one who will charge a lot....one who will charge them a lesser amount because they don't want to empty their pockets.......IT's all about being selfish and you know that. Why do companies hire employees who will work for a lower wage?....cause the more money you got the more you want to have and keep....and a lot of these companies have people who invest their money on them and an investor wants results, profits,.....and if the person who is in charge of running the company is not giving them the results that they want.....well they have a great chance of loosing their job to someone who is competent and can give them the output and results the investors want. Don't start blaming all the mexicans for america's problems, as far as I know, mexicans aren't the only people immigrating to america so stop saying it's thier fault. All this blame should be put on the US GOVERNMENT, and you know why! They are aware and have been aware for the past 40 years that there is a shi* load of immigrants coming in through the southern, northern borders....coming in through our ports, and even people who come here as tourists with a passport that never go back.....and they didn't and still haven't done anaything about it...so if you say that americans are so great because they have done so many things for this economy...well where were they when they elected the president and their senators? Because it's the american people who chose them...not us....(the immigrants).....so for this guy up here if you want to blame the immigrants I say do some research before you start typing away....the only ones responsible for this are the Greedy Coroporations/companies/investors and the GOVERNMENT!!!!!!!!!!!IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY!!!!!"

Wouldn't you want the government to help you get a new start in life after you just lost everything you owned and now left in a unfamiliar place?

9,"Without a doubt, its meant as a protection that was not awarded in England thus the term 'debtors prison.'  As a result people without the ability to file for bankruptcy were thrown into prison to die and later during colonial times sent into indentured servitude to pay off debts.  Almost all abuses of the bankruptcy system are perpetuated by corporations under 'reorganizing' and other businesses that get to curtail debt through a court approved settlement.  Or Donald Trump filing repeatedly because he puts his name in companies when he buys for himself. Most bankruptcy now, since chapter 7 is so limited by recent legislation never absolves the debt, but only gives an easier repayment plan to the debtors under different chapters of the bankruptcy code.  So in 95% of all instances for individuals, it merely makes a payment option that is afforable; hopefully for them as to have ability for food and shelter still.  Instead of taking everything from them, making them homeless, we allow people to live and not be thrown into prison, it was one of the major complaints of the colonists about English rule and strictly prohibited and why US started bankruptcy.

Something my friends and I noticed while I was in; if you ask a soldier what he does, he will tell you ""I am in the Army."" Navy? ""I am in the Navy."" Air Force? ""I am in the Air Force."" But if you ask a Marine what he does, he/she will tell you ""I am a Marine!""  That is something no one else in the world can say.  For 230 years the Marine Corps has been monkey stomping anyone that needs it.  There has never been a mutiny in the Marine Corps.  Hence the motto ""Semper Fidelis."" Which means ""Always Faithful.""  It applies to more than that also. It applies to the fact that, if we can help it, we never leave a man on the battlefield.  Wounded or dead.  We take care of our own.  From experience with other branches of service they learn a little about their service history.  Marines learn everything about their service history.  It is no longer the history of the Marine Corps, it is MY history as well. I was a Sergeant. I was leader of Marines.  That is one of the greatest feelings in the world.  Almost as good as the day I stood on top of ""The Reaper,"" and my Senior Drill Instructor put that Eagle,Globe, and Anchor in my hand, and told me(this by the way was the first time in the entire 13 weeks of boot camp that any Marine is addressed as Marine, only when their training is complete are you a Marine.) ""Congratulations Marine. Welcome to the Corps.""  Marines have pride in their service in part because of our history, and also because we had to earn the title Marine.  We had to earn the right to be called Marine.  Everyone else is a soldier, sailor, or airman as soon as they get to basic training.  Not Marines. I was every derogatory term except.  I certainly wasn't a human being. But then it was all worth it.  Marines are the first to fight.  Whatever you think your chances of going to Iraq or Afghanistan are...double it.  I'm not trying to Scare you away, but every Marine is a rifleman. Our pilots learn learn infantry combat tactics.  Oh by the way the whole Navy pilots are the best thing. Only the top 10% of Naval Flight School, are allowed to be Marine pilots.  Someone had mentioned the Navy SEALs.  You can be a Navy SEAL even if you are a Marine.  The SEALs are Special Forces and thus are open for anyone in the Armed Services to try.  But why do that, the Corps just started its own Special Forces program.

9,"The government (in this case, the cop who wrote the ticket), always has the burden of proving their case (that *you* ran a red light).  You can show up for court and say nothing, if you like.  \n\nIf, after the cop testifies, you choose to speak, you can.  I'm assuming the cop has his/her reasons for thinking it was you driving, and I'd be willing to bet you contributed greatly to those reasons (switch seats with someone, did you?).\n\nNo, you (probably) don't have to say who the driver was.  The government has to prove that you were the driver and you are allowed to challenge that if you want to try, but it's still the government's burden to prove their case.  However, if you just show up and tell the judge ""it wasn't me,"" you're not likely going to get very far.\n\nEDIT 4.19.06:\n\nSo you've answered your own question, haven't you?

Get a lawyer or look up online the family laws both for USA national and international and Canada national and international family laws. Do not give up, don't let anyone discourage you, it will take time but you will win your son back fully or to some degree.  You can bet that she is looking over her shoulder every minute.  And every time someone is knocking on her door she is thinking that it is the FBI. Again DO NOT GIVE UP KEEP AT IT, even if all seems useless. And if she could do what she did I quite well imagine that you could do the same except in the opposite direction, from Canada to USA with the child.  What nationality is the child?

I voted for John Kerry because I do feel extremely ashamed of the president that these people picked for me. I still can't believe that these people who still support him cannot see through his stupidity and lies. He lied about Iraq having WMD's and he lied about not being able to stop the catastrophe that happened in New Orleans. He should have overridden FEMA and all of the other disaster organizations, had them organized and ready to go, and had supplies from all across the nation and other countries lined up and ready to go. But what did he do? He was in California learning how to play the guitar... this shows what a true leader this man is. Forget about New Orleans and what's about to occur, me learning how to play the guitar is more important. Canada and Mexico offered to give us food, clothing, etc., but we didn't accept it. Why? Because Bush told them that we didn't need their help. Just like when Wal-Mart had tons of 18-wheelers stocked with bottled water so that way these people would have clean water to drink, they told them to turn their 18-wheelers around cause they didn't need their help.

9,"First and foremost, I would set up a multinational coalition of the willing, and rid the world of terrorism. I would help this coalition dispose of terrorists wherever they hide, and overthrow any government that supports them or aids them in hiding. \n\nOn the home front, I would secure the nation's borders by placing more border patrol personnel on all of the borders. I would hold any business that employs illegal immigrants to the full extent of the law. Any immigrant that decides to try and beat the system by not declaring their intentions will be treated as a criminal, and likewise will be held to the full extent of the law.\n\nI would reduce the size of the federal government. I believe that there are too many federal agencies providing services that the states should provide for themselves. I would allocate the funds from the recently dismissed agencies to better education and technological advancement, especially in the fields of science and bio-fuels. \n\nI would stress the importance to all the states' governors to educate their citizens. Ignorance breeds ignorance. I would offer all states monetary rewards for reduction in crime levels in areas where crime is well above the national average. The children of this nation will live in an enviroment that is both safe and encourages education.\n\nI would stress to the states' governors the importance of encouraging small business in under privileged areas.

9,"The Royal Navy had been using a converted cruiser, HMS Hermes, as a seaplane carrier, to conduct trials in 1913. On the outbreak of the First World War a number of cross channel ferries were converted as well. However, another ship was needed, and in 1914 a tramp steamer was requisitioned whilst under construction. This 7,000-ton vessel was turned into the first purpose-built aircraft carrying vessel, HMS Ark Royal in Blyth, Northumberland. She could carry five floatplanes and 2 normal aircraft. The latter would have to return to land after launch, but the seaplanes could take off over the bow and land in the water alongside the carrier, before being lifted back into the hold by crane.\n\nThe ship spent the war in the Eastern Mediterranean and took part in the Dardanelles campaign from February to May 1915.\n\nIn January 1918 two of her Sopwith ABC planes attempted to bomb SMS Goeben.\n\nAfter the war she operated in the Black Sea, transporting aircraft to Batumi to support White Russian forces fighting the Russian Civil War. She was also used in support of the land campaign in Somalia against the Mad Mullah.\n\nDuring 1920 she assisted the withdrawal of White Russian forces from Crimea. She then returned to Britain and was put into reserve at Rosyth for a refit.\n\nShe was recommissioned in September 1922 to take aircraft out to the Mediterranean during the Chanak crisis, before undergoing another refit at Malta in April 1923.\n\nIn December 1934 she was renamed HMS Pegasus to free her name for a new carrier that was then beginning construction.\n\nHMS Pegasus served in only minor roles during the Second World War, and was sold in December 1946. Work began to convert her into a merchant ship named Anita I, but this was halted and she was broken up for scrap in 1949.\n\nSee HMS Ark Royal for other ships of the same name."

9,"Hmmm. Personally, I don't believe in Capital Punishment, if that's what you mean. I don't think it's the government's place to kill people. I believe in justice, not vengeance for our legal system.\nRevenge is a personal matter, not a matter for the state.\nIt is unreasonable to expect the state to kill someone for you. You want him dead, do it yourself. Someone killed your daughter? You want him beaten to death? You do it, and then find a way to get away with it.\n\nFor me, vengeance is carried out by the one wronged, or not at all.\nNow, as for how I would carry out my revenge for some horrible wrong done to me or my loved ones. I don't think it would be prudent for me to go into details, but I probably wouldn't kill the person, but leave them in a bad way, so that they would have a long long time to think about what they had done while they have to have a nurse wipe their @ss, and while she's doing it (something she has done for years for many people) she will think ""my god, this is the most horrid job ever."" as she holds back vomit. And she would have to smoke a cigarette after work with jittery hands and try so desperately to forget the image of what is left of a human being, but she can't because it's etched into her brain and her dreams of him awaken her at night and in a cold sweat, and she will always remember the remnants of the man in the hospital bed, who no longer looks like a man. And he will always have a pain, somewhere, a different pain in a different place everyday, so that it never dulls and he never gets used to it, and he can never ever forget who he wronged because that pain is always there.\nThat would be my revenge."

9,What event? Where?
9,Below I linked one site that shows a picture of the two together.
9,"It is classified as a ""transitional government"" by the United States CIA.  Here is an additional note: ""following a successful referendum on independence for the Autonomous Region of Eritrea on 23-25 April 1993, a National Assembly, composed entirely of the People's Front for Democracy and Justice or PFDJ, was established as a transitional legislature; a Constitutional Commission was also established to draft a constitution; ISAIAS Afworki was elected president by the transitional legislature; the constitution, ratified in May 1997, did not enter into effect, pending parliamentary and presidential elections; parliamentary elections had been scheduled in December 2001, but were postponed indefinitely; currently the sole legal party is the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ)"""
9,"don't confuse liberals with the truth,  Bush is in the oil business, so liberals want something to attack bush on, and lies work well if told loud enougn  and long enough\n\nThe government over all ( congress) does control the oil industry,  they tell them where they can drill and where they can't.  They tell them how they can drill,  they control how the oil has to be transported, stored and treated.\n\nSo in basics, there is no way for them to complete really against each other using any different method, since they are all controled.  And they all pay about the same price for imported oil\n\nAnd oil companies are making alot of profit now because they can't explore for oil hardly anywhere,  off shore of Fla and California have been blocked in court,  they can't in alot of alaska.\n\nAnd if you look not at the total billions profit, but look at the precent of profit,  it is so low that if they were not that big, they would close,  if a store or other business operated at the percent of profit oil companies do they would be considered operating poorly.  It is only thier pure size that makes them appear to be making such a big profit."
9,"Each small to medium sized town usually has a village board.  The members of the board are usually trustees , counsel, and the village president or mayor.  The meetings for the board are normally listed in the local newspaper.  To attend the meeting, you may want to call ahead and explain your agenda, in this way, the board will be somewhat prepared to discuss this matter with some authority."
9,"WE use the race card? Pro-illegals are the ones that state that ""Not all illegal immigrants are Mexican"", then say that ""The only reason you people hate illegals is that you don't want a taste of the Hispanic culture."""
9,"There's always going to be someone like you, isn't there?  Sigh..."
9,"Moving Isreal to Europe was an idea put forth by the new conservative leader of Iran, who in the span of a couple of months has managed to alienate himself,and his government ,from the rest of the world faster than even George Bush in his post-election cowboy heyday.The new leader of Iran is certifiable, and Israel might just knock on his door very loudly if he persists in his goal of making nuclear weapons. Israel isn't moving to Europe, but they may pay a visit to Tehran!"
9,I think you'll hear that on TV once all the votes have been counted and the results are finalized.
9,I would do whatever i can to help them.
9,"Being a former soldier who just left Iraq for the second time, I really would not want the teddy bear I would rather have a beer. But getting one from the one I loved was great . It was something that was not ""me"" and reminded me of that person. So in the end I had 5 teddy bears that sat in a locker in Baghdad that I looked at every morning for a second and made me feel like I was home if but for an instant. I had 5 because I have 4 daughters and a wife. Send him the damn bear so he can hide it and think of you!!! :)"
9,the one who got caught with drugs ED....something he helped my brother
9,"Yes I believe it should be legalized, because in relation to other drugs that are currently legal, the deleterious effects of marijuana simply don’t compare. I think the distribution of it should be controlled as to where it can be smoked, and who is licensed to sell it."
9,The answer is YES. Lying is his main function.
9,"You would think so, I'm not sure."
9,"tons, look in the newspapers. I have temporarily relocated to mississippi."
9,In general there are no regulations regarding prices that people charge for services. The price is set by the market.
9,"My speech would be about how humbled I am and I now realize I wasn't representing the American people but my own self interests , it won't happen again . If anyone needs me I'll be at the ranch ."
9,"Hopefully at that point some US states will break away.  If not, i would suggest a less socialist country.  Maybe one with very few people.  The more people there are, the more government becomes oppressive and paternalistic.  New Zealand might be a good option.  But they may take immigration seriously.  And then we're screwed."
9,"just one more thing ... even if the cop does show up , plead not guilty, and the cop will most likely pull you aside before the  hearing and   give you a  plea bargain to a lesser charge - as long as you are respectful, and did not give him/ her a hard time when you got the ticket...trust me ... I know ...."
9,"What ultimately made life possible for the 'pilgrims' was something akin to capitalism. They started out in more of a commune system, which about killed them off, b/c there's no incentive to work (produce).\n\nYou need people that are focused on getting ahead, aggressively."
9,"I agree that this is obvious.  Iraq was probably the hegemon in the Middle East before the US invasion, though Iran had already been clamoring for increased power and influence in the region.  Now that Iraq has fallen into great turmoil, Iran now has an opportunity to increase its influence and establish itself as the leading Muslim nation, much as the US is considered the leading democratic nation.  Iran has much to gain from a destabilized Iraq, and is thus contributing to the violence through weapons sales."
9,"People do have a right to burn a lot of things, including a flag!  But if you are burning the American flag, then you might as well set yourself on fire!  That's because the American flag stands as a symbol for the freedom of expression, and the freedom to burn flags!  And if you are burning the symbol of expression, the very symbol which allows you to burn the flag itself, then in effect you are rejecting you freedom of expression which the American flag stands for!  If you are burning the flag, you are basically saying that you do not want to have freedom to express yourself constructively, and in a positive manner!  In a sense you are rejecting the very freedom which enables you to burn the flag!  It does seem kind of odd for most people that anybody would want to burn the flag of their own country, especially a country which is very tolerant of these types of irrational expressions!  All I am trying to say is - don't bite the hand that fed you!  If you do not like this country, then leave!  Go to Canada, or Mexico, or Iran, (while there, try burning that country's flag for everybody to see, I would pay money to see that)!  But no, you see just the opposite happening, more people want to come to this country, because this country more than any other allows for Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness, and amongst many other things, the right to express yourself, and speak your mind!  No, I am not saying that this country is perfect, but compared to the rest of the world, it just might be!"
9,He wasnt even there for it so he didnt know what he was talking about. It is really hard to pay attention to what is going on in a war when you are busy boozing it up with your buddies every night.
9,"The latest information from the State Bar is from 2003 and covers the whole state. Then, the median income for private lawyers was $117,136 a year. The median for private lawyers with 3-6 years of experience was $80,353. In law firms with 41-60 employees, the median was $164,216. In criminal law, the median was $76,307. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the median was $125,000. There are not enough firms with 41-60 lawyers in the Dallas area to give a median, however for those with 200+, it was $200,000. In Dallas-Fort Worth, the median for criminal practice lawyers was $84,167."
9,IF YOU FIND OUT LET ME KNOW SO THAT I CAN WIPE MY ARSE WITH IT!!
9,"Watch or listen to CSPAN now. There is a hearing on that. The General just said We need more troops, another said, We need an exit strategy. \nIn one month the Baker meet will be over and then and only then will we will know anything. \nMy opinion is that there should be 3, one Sunni, one Shiite and one Kurd. Each with their own accepted borders, and all sharing equally in any oil revenues from all 3 Countries or States. \nThe Shia and Sunni are never going to get along, and the Kurds just add an extra element of dispute. So give them all 3 equally shares of land, in relation to their original lands and with some acknowledgment as to Census Status, i.e. 3million Shia, 3million acre, 2 million Sunnis 2 million acres, 1million Kurds, 1 million acre. Or something like that. Seems fair, they all get Oil Revenues equally, and no one is or can take anothers land."
9,Neither. Just a very aggressive monkey who has been taught basic speech skills.
9,"More people would be more apt to respond if you changed your question to include something like....ohhh...correct spelling?  \n\nA democrad?  WTF is a democrad?

Don't shorten words (i.e. u for you).  Try again."
9,"It could all be resolved simply by posting troops on the border. Since 9-11, the rules have changed, if mexicans or whoever at any border can come across freely so can terrorists. I say troops on the border for national security."
9,"1) Why are impeachment hearings not going on for President Bush?\nA) wire tapping\nB) lied to american people to go to war\nC) has been quoted after 9/11 saying, ""find a way to get us into iraq""\n\nAnswers:\nA) The wire tapping was legal, and judged so by the courts.  Your efforts to encourage impeachment in a time of war is seditious and a serious condemnation of either the level of your education, or the commitment you have to our country.\nB) Lied? Consider the following: \nKerry, Former President Clinton (during and after his terms), Edwards, Former First Lady Hillary Clinton, the U.N., all of these said Saddam had WMDs (We know he did, we watched him use them on his own people).  President Clinton said in one speech that our experts watched Saddam smuggle weapons out back doors while the U.N. investigators were coming in the front door (during his terms).\n\nThe excuse that they all depended on President Bush's ""lie"" doesn't work.  President Clinton said Saddam had them before President Bush ever did, and Saddam himself was telling his allies that he had them!\n\nYour seditious rumor that ""Bush lied"" is seen for what it is by the U.S. citizens, and expect it to be an expensive attempt to undermine our country and our elected leaders.  Not that we will all vote Republican!  I'm a Democrat, but I have no interest in voting for name-calling, seditious, lying representatives who carelessly spread rumors.  I will vote for a Democrat with ethics, or if their isn't one, perhaps whoever has the most ethics in another party.\n\n3) All of us have had enough of people taking sound-bytes out of context.  Do some actual research instead of attacking our country and look at the rest of what the President said.  He did say it.  The U.N. was not getting the job done, Saddam wouldn't allow U.S.A. inspectors to come in.  President Bush wanted to ""get into Iraq"" to get the job done the U.N. failed to do for a decade.\n\nWe see what you are doing, both Democrats and Republicans.  We know that we (Democrats and Republicans) are not the enemy.  Oh, we disagree, but we stand behind the elected leaders of our country, majority democratic choice, legal dissent and disagreement, and most of all, each other.\n\nWe stand against name-calling of our leaders (Presidents Clinton or Bush, or any other).\n\nWe stand against spreading unfounded rumors and lies.\n\nWe stand against what you are doing.\n\nYou want to actually discuss wire tapping?  Do some research and then dissent, without trying to attack our leader.\n\nYou want to disagree with why we went to war?  Great.  Stop telling us a lie about the President.  He may have been wrong.  That is not a lie.\n\nYou want to quote him?  Quote him in context and at least quote something about the subject you are actually talking about rather than transposing a quote from one subject (getting U.S. inspectors into Iraq) to another (the decision to go to war).\n\nWhat you do sickens us, and our country, literally.\n\nYou may have Free Speech, but so do we.\n\nExpect us to answer you."
9,"Comparative advantage is not a general principle, but a specific type of advantage relating to international trade. The site below explains it rather well. As you can tell from that, it cannot have anything to do with production by firms."
9,"Give the deadheads in Washington (new and old) some time to figure out what has to be done in Iraq and elsewhere.  It should only take them 2-3 years to make a decision whether to vote on it or not.   I am glad that the Dems have taken over the House (no, I am not a Dem) because they will rebalance the government.  Bush will probably have to use his veto power many times, but the nation will know exactly where he stands and where the Dems stand. If they are smart (which they aren't. They are politicians) they will join together and get something done for the American people.  No more sitting on their asses doing nothing. We will see!"
9,"Hillary Clinton for many reasons, she is intelligent and centered which is extremely important now. Our Political System and our Nation have been Divided not United under George W. Bush."

9,"If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential."
9,"Because logic like yours is faulty.  What about if it was 3:30?  3:00?  2:30?  1:00?  Where do you draw the line?\n\nYou don't get to decide when you have to stop at a stop sign and when you don't.  If that was permissible, then people would get to make up their own ""stop sign hours"" like you seem to want to, and we'd have chaos on the roads."
9,"That depends largely on what type of drugs you have used and how often.  I know people who have gotten security clearance with light past drug use.  I would say nothing harder than marijuana, years ago, only a few times.  Anything more than that and you're probably out of luck.\n\nOf course, the DUI's are a concern as well but I don't know anything about how they relate to security clearances because none of my friends have had one."

It was signed into law by President Reagan on October 1, 1986.\n\nAmong other changes, Goldwater-Nichols streamlined the military chain of command, which now runs from the President through the Secretary of Defense directly to unified combat commanders, bypassing the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were assigned an advisory role."

9,"Bush's big picture? Well you should check out prisonplanet.com quite the eye opening experience. Some people might say it's conspiracy theory, but some of it just seems to fall into place. If none of that is true, just look at what he has done with foreign policy. He's isolated the U.S. not many countries are very happy with us right now. I've had friends who have traveled abroad that have to say they're from Canada just to not get yelled at and ridiculed. Pro Bush people (I live with one) believe that he is doing a great job, that the war in Iraq was justified to remove Saddam (who had nothing to do with 911 and no wmds.) So now we sit here with an ongoing war that was declared over by bush with rising fuel prices due to his provoking of foreign nations as well as creating instability in the region we import our oil from. Now venezuela bolivia and cuba have cut trade with the U.S. because of all of them dislike of bush, and his policies. The big picture is to create a world government (democracy) and have everyone live free while big business rakes in the cash. My thought is live and let live. I know that there are countries that opress and ones that don't but you would think that in todays da and age we could use diplomacy to settle disputes instead of threatening them with bombs. We are so set in the past of Vietnam, WWI, WWII, that we for some reason think that the world owes us something when they don't owe us crap. Yes our troops faught and died for other countries, but so did their citizens. We were at one time united against a common enemy, and yes there is a common enemy of terrorism, but bush distorted that idea and crusaded around saying we needed to rid the world of people like North Korea, Iran, Iraq, it was just so easy for him to gain support by blaming it all for 911. Ok so I'm rambling, but I hope that might give you some idea. The big picture isn't for everyone."

The mandate includes preventing human rights violations, securing respect for all human rights, promoting international cooperation to protect human rights, coordinating related activities throughout the United Nations, and strengthening and streamlining the United Nations system in the field of human rights.

9,In the beginning................................................................................
9,"I am proud to be an American, I am ashamed of those who in office voilate the very oaths they are under affirmation to uphold, defend and preserve.\nOur founding fathers left their homes and came to America to start a new world, a world where people had the right to choose the religion of their choice without persecution. They also did not believe that a man should be placed in jail because he owed someone money, thus they were against debtor prisons. They believed that all men were created equal and that each person had the right to liberty and the persuit of happiness. That that right was not granted by man but by the creator.\nThe consitution declares itself the supreme law of the land, therefore there is no federal law, no state law or city ordance that can supercede it. It goes on and states that any law that is found in contridiction of it is null and void. We were meant to be a country of the people and for the people. Not a country where one because of his income had more rights than those who did not have the same amount of money. We are each granted equal protection of the law under the consitution, unfortunately we have had leaders in office over the years who did not honour their oaths, they enacted laws that are in direct contridiction of the consitution. They deglated duties that congress was to fullfill to private corporations, which they had no right to do. They are currently taxing the citizens in violation of the consitution because it is tax without approriation, it is a slave tax, and the 13th admendment strictly forbids slavery. Yet our current government believes that it owns the citizens of this nation. It doesn't but acts as if it does. In 1913 on Christmas eve when the majority of congressmen had returned to their homes for the holidays, a group of congressmen stayed behind and enacted what has become known as the Federal Reserve Act. It is this act that Woodrow Wilson claimed on his death bed that he had betrayed his country unaware. It was an act just like it that Andrew Jackson called a den of theives and vipers and by his eternal God he was going to route them out. He refused to renew their charter and was able to keep them out for 77 years. Lincoln during the civil war stated he had two great enemies, the south in frount of him and the international bankers behind him, of the two he feared the bankers the most. Lincoln did not finance the civil war through international bankers that wanted to charge him 29% intrest rate, he instead went to congress and told congress to issue out from the treasury the funds needed to finance the war. They became known as Lincoln greenbacks because they were green on the back side. Then in 1913 we had a private corporation to take control of our monetary system. Ben Franklin stated that if a private corporation ever got a hold of the monetary system that the children of the founding fathers would grow up homeless in the land that their fathers founded. It is intresting to note that the only bill that does not bare the face of a dead president is the 100 dollar bill which has the face of Ben Franklin on it who was never president. It is also intresting to note that the first president is on the 1 dollar bill whereas the man who was not ever president is on the 100 dollar bill. Then we had the great depression after this event of 1913, think that there was really a shortage of money? Not really it was the means in which this private corporation was able to take control of the publishing houses, newspapers, etc. How do you control the masses? Simple you control what they know. Why do you think our government hates the internet so much. They cannot control its content. Then in 1960 we had a very close election, between Richard Nixon and JFK. JFK won. JFK had no intrest in keeping troops in Vietnam and was in the process of withdrawing all troops who were there. He also understood the consitution and realized that congress had made a grave error by deglating their du"

Most countries will not tolerate any outside interference in regards to how they run their own government... that is one of the main reasons why countries are invaded.\nMexico patrols its southern border mostly because of US pressure because most latinamerican immigrants have to come to Mexico before going to the US and this also causes a lot of trouble for Mexico. There are lots of rapes and robberies going on not only on the south but all through Mexico and some of the most dangerous gangs (like La Mara Salvatrucha) are stablishing ang breaking havoc in Mexico before migrating to the US. \nMexico's economy is better than some ountries in Latin America and although the goal of most of the immigrants is not to stay permanently in Mexico they have to compete there for the available jobs, and in Mexico, Mexicans are willing to take any available job. We cannot afford to be choosy and say we are not worth a job so let the illegal immigrants take it."

9,"""Freedom of Expression"" is a concept that means that someone has the right to express views-- no matter how unpopular-- without fear of being persecuted or punished for what he has said. In a strictly political sense, freedom of speech is meant to protect the rights of people who have a grievance against the government or have unpopular views in general. It was created because in the past, Western leaders [or religious organizations] had the practice of condemning, imprisoning, or killing people who expressed views that they didn't like. (For example, Honore Daumier [a 19th century French cartoonist] was imprisoned for printing cartoons that the French government found offensive.) \n\nSo Freedom of Expression is a concept meant to protect the rights of people who have unpopular views, especially if it's against the government or other authorities with immense power. They cannot be imprisoned or persecuted or exiled. It is a good concept. The problem, however, is that this concept has now been corrupted by many people, who feel that Freedom of Expression means being as insensitive and rude as you feel like, and not expect to get a negative reaction for it. It has also become a crutch [lazy] response when someone does something that creates controversy and doesn't really address the issue head on. I don't know much about this Danish cartoon affair, but this may have happened in this case."

9,"Many Republicans are Christians. Certain variations of Christianity are opposed to birth control because they feel that sex should only be used for reproduction (hence the song ""Every sperm is sacred"" from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life).\n\nFeelings against wellfare generally revolve around the idea that people should be responsibie for their own lives. In the US, people have a lot of freedom and opportunity available to them. With this freedom comes responsibility. People who spend most of their lives on wellfare usually are choosing not to do things to improve their lives (I know this firsthand. My mother was on wellfare until I was 16).\n\nThe other aspect of wellfare is individual rights. If you lost your job, do you have the right to go into someone's house, hold a gun to their head, and make them give you ""unemployment compensation?"" Obviously not. Wellfare recipients are paid with tax money. Tax money is obtained in the same manner. (Have you ever tried to NOT pay taxes?)\n\nThe death penalty is a little more complicated. There are plenty of non-republicans who are in favor of the death penalty. The thought is usually that the person ""deserves"" it and should not be a burden on society by consuming valuable prison resources."

9,"I too am in the military with a spotless record. After wasting time in Iraq securing oil while being pounded by propoganda messages from our own government it became more clear to me that there is more to 9/11 than meets the eye. First off, it wasn't Clinton's fault entirely. He didn't sell secrets to the Chinese either. We have always had spies in this country. Just so happens that the republicans were on a witch hunt for Clinton from day one and anything he did or anything that happened became larger than life. Secondly, President Bush recieved all the intelligence that Clinton had and he sat on it as well. There was clear evidence an attack was going to occur. We had leads we ignored. Someone was telling these people to look the other way. Third, the economy was  in a rut. Wars fix bad economies. This administration was hell bent on going to war with Iraq since day one. This administration let the attacks occur as an excuse to go to war. I don't think they realized how devestating the attacks would be. We all sat and watched the towers burn. Did anyone believe they would fall? Not even the builder or the government foresaw that. Which brings me full circle to my time in Iraq. We sat there for 147 days getting our heads filled with messages from our govt such as: ""Saddam has weapons he will use against us and is developing WMD's to use against the world."" How odd he hadn't done so in 10 previous years and suddenly after 9/11 he's the problem? Then we heard, ""you're doing this to free Iraqi's from a terrible oppressor with dangerous weapons."" Then General Tommy Franks said ""If Saddam had just turned over his weapons, he would still be in charge."" So much for doing it for the Iraqi's. Clearly removing the oppresor was not the issue. Finally it went to ""This is for the war on terror."" And I restate, how did Iraq fold into this. Afghanistan was harboring the worlds greatest criminal. But it was to hard to fight them. Besides, President Bush wanted Iraq, an easy target. Korea was to tough with nukes. Whose the bully, us or Iraq? The government wants you to think like them. Actually, they prefer you don't think. They continue to strip away your liberties based on your fears and you give them up easily. Is it so hard then to believe that they haven't been lying to you all along?"

His prognosis was reported as ""extremely bleak"" after the surgery and he was placed on a respirator in intensive care. Hadassah director, Professor Shlomo Mor-Yosef, reported at 14:00 Israel Time, following the seven-hour surgery, that the bleeding had stopped: ""all the parameters are according to expectations after an operation of this type."" The doctors estimate his chances for recovery as being ""very low."" Another surgery was undertaken the following day, as well as a third more minor surgery. On January 6, 17:50 Israeli Time, Mor-Yosef reported ""significant improvement"" in the reduction of intracranial pressure which was threatening to do further damage. Sharon's condition remains ""stable, but still critical"". Another official report is expected on January 7, no sooner than 18:00 Israeli Time (16:00 GMT, 11:00 EST).\n\nOn the night of Sharon's stroke, in the wake of his serious illness, and following consultations between Government Secretary Israel Maimon and Attorney General Meni Mazouz, the Prime Minister was declared ""temporarily incapable of discharging his powers"", and Ehud Olmert, the Deputy Prime Minister, was officially confirmed as the Acting Prime Minister of Israel.

And this does not make me racist...it makes me sensible..illegal is illegal, period.  And to the people who are going to talk about the laws 200 years ago...times have changed, laws have changed.. Check out citizenship laws in Mexico...they don't allow illegal immigrants, much less give them drivers lisences, translate all into a foreign language for their convenience, or allow them to protest."

In a town near where I live they are trying to pass laws about drinking and I refuse to sign them as I figure if you can let a person vote or join the military at 18 then they sure as heck ought to be responsible enough to drink.  Maybe they should change the age limit on joining the military and voting.  (Voting was changed to 18 during the Vietnam war as a result of students protesting against the war in Vietnam and was thought to be a valid way for them to voice their opinions rather then demonstrating, which no government likes, even our own, as they can become highly explosive incidents).

9,"What IS the national guard's job again? As I recall the PRIMARY job, & sole purpose for its creation, is indeed to defend the national borders & internal security of the US. The SECONDARY job is to backup federal troops overseas, and AFTER all that, to respond to natural disasters when local authories are overwhelmed, incapable, or incompetent to do so. And, when they are under the command of a Gov, they DO have law enforcement powers. \n\nSo, not only do I think they should send 6,000 down to build infrastructure & run survellince gear, I think they ought to send 30,000 & give them guns. It's a drop in the bucket. I really don't care so much about the illegals. There's so many here now using services that even if you could seal the border we'd still be bleeding to death. You honestly can't have a wide open border in time of terrorist war though & you have to cut off the drug flow. They should have done this 25 years ago & not pulled troops till border patrol could hard seal the border alone. This is just a political statment though."
9,"The whole Islamic world is not even, or will ever be, allied with itself.  I realize that American public education and our universities fail miserably at teaching the truth about other cultures, so here is a run down.\n\nThere are two main sects in Islam (not Muslim as being ""Muslim"" is a state of Islam, akin to ""Nirvana"").  These are the Sunnis and the Shia.  The Sunnis think the Shia are aposates and traitors to Islam.  Within the Sunni sect, there are several other subsects of which Whabbasism is just one.  Trying to get all these sects to agree on what day it even is is difficult enough.  Having them unite as one is almost impossible.  \n\nThis is further complicated by the fact African, Far Eastern, and Indonesian Islamists don't like the Arabs, or each other.  Al Qeada's pay and command structure further infuriated non-Arab Islamic people.  Old Bin Lying doesn't pay non-Arabs as much as Arabs or let them be as high ranking in his clubhouse.  Plus, the genocide in Sudan and othert parts is being caused by Islamic Arabs killing Islamic Africans, along with Christian Africans.  BTW, Islam refers to Jesus Christ as a prophit and pays homage to him (Guess Bin Lying forgot to read that part of the Quran!).\n\nMixed into this further the tribal and clan nature of the Middle East and Africa.  The US, USSR, UK, and others have always been able to fracture the alliances by either buying off a clan or allowing the clans to fight themselves, which is usually what happens without Western involvement.\n\nAnd to top it off, a large and growing number of Islamic peoples do not hate America or what it is doing.  Efforts in Afghanistan, Kuwait, Indonesia, Pakistan, and other areas where the US Military and NGOs go in are paying monumental dividends.\n\nIraqis are siding with the USA, as are Jordanians, as are the oppressed people of Iran (they just can't do much about it right now.. such is what always happens when you disarm the people).  Then there are the Pastdun people of Pakistan, who, after Al Qeada abandoned them following the massive earthquake that killed 80,000+, saw the ones who rushed in was...come on, guess....That's right, the USA!  And who sent massive aid to Indonesia, dispite the lies from leftists in the UN?  The USA wins there too by sending very high level, and possibly vulnerable assets to the disaster area.  Just like we did for Katrina later, the US military sent assault ships, one of our two hospital ships, and an aircraft carrier without its fighters but loaded with supplies and helos (the USS Kittyhawk) to the area.  These efforts speak volumes to the people of the area and cause a rift between them and our enemies.\n\nSo, yes, we stand a great chance since the Islamic world is difficult to unite and easy to fracture."

It is acceptable to dislike the man if you choose. A poster about above me stated that it is patriotic to criticize, I can accept that, but there is a difference between constructive criticism and absolute slander and many just appear to be unable to separate the two. Do not be deterred by the negative responses you have received here. If you like the President for whatever reason that is your right and speaking out about why you like him is perfectly acceptable. Your opinions are just as valid as any of the detractors. Freedom of speech is a double edged sword, while we may not like the things that are said it is still the right of people to say these things. In a perfect world people would intelligently discuss issues, but alas the world we live in is far from perfect."
9,"The realities of the oil crunch and energy-hungry nations have forced many countries into a potential global conflict.

The American government has been led by wealth over many years,and the current administration is not an exception. Perhaps we should require a different document....not of independence but a curriculum vitae of elected officials as well as proof of their financial dealings."

9,Okay now that I looked back on the rest of your question your talking about President Bush.\nYou know I was totally anti Bush because 9/11 happened on his watch. However after reading some of the pro Bush stuff and reviewing fact not just propaganda.\nLets Just review some facts here.\n1. The first time the world trade center was attacked was backed in the 90's There was some lives lost not sure how many. However the building were deemed indestructible\n2. There is a terrorist that was catch in the UK recently. He has footage of places in the us that was taken months before 9/11 where one can see the security around and about the twin towers. The security was enough to dissuaded this person from attacking the us on the ground. \n3. Could it have been possible that the president did hear from the CIA that there is a possibility of a terrorist threat. Thus beefing security. \n4. Five the CIA was right about terrorist attacks! Now they tell you that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. And you know that Saddam hates you (Americans) This is a man who inflicted genocide on his own people. What would you do?

The Americans supported and armed the Mujadin during the 1980's in which a lot  of terrorist   leaders got their training and learned how to fight against a formal country in this case Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980's. And after the Soviets left the Afghanistan we left the rebels high and dry and they were forced to a civil war. Has for the terrorism part especially suicide bombings it didn't start until the Iran and Iraq war were a young man (16 i believe) strapped on a bomb went after an Iraqi tank.  Khomeini the leader of Iran during this time saw an opportunity    were he can be idolized just like on of the successors to Mohammad was after a battle were the warriors were claimed to be Martyrs. The Americans did not back this regime but they backed Iraq's and prior regime in Iran. So, they were seen has the enemies. So, in short  both Americans and English did play a part in the rise of Islamic terrorism but it was also some Muslims leaders played a part in it."

9,"Most U.S. citizens enter Canada without doing more than briefly showing their driver's license.  You MAY be stopped and asked if you have a criminal record and the Canadian authorities could deny you entry if they find out about your record.  If you went over the border at a busy crossing like Niagara Falls or Detroit/Windsor, I'd be surprised if you were stopped.  Here's the official line from the U.S. Dept. of State:\n\n""All persons entering Canada may be required to present proof of citizenship and identity.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to show a U.S. passport.  If they do not have a passport, they should be prepared to provide a government-issued photo ID (e.g. Driver’s License) and proof of U.S. citizenship such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, or expired U.S. passport.  A visa is not required for U.S. citizens to visit Canada of up to 180 days.  Anyone seeking to enter Canada for any purpose besides a visit, (e.g. to work, study or immigrate) should contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest consulate prior to travel.  Anyone with a criminal record (including some misdemeanors such as Driving While Impaired (DWI) charges) may be excluded or removed from Canada, and should contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest Canadian consulate well in advance of any planned travel for further processing, which may take some time."""

9,"At least twice each week I read the rant of another angry American who declares that Bush is an idiot, but if they're just figuring that out now, they're throwing stones from a glass house. Of course he's an idiot. They needed an idiot. If the man displayed any signs of intelligence, evil actions couldn't be  passed off as ""failures"" or ""bungling."" If the president were intelligent and scholarly, people would question why he's completely incompetent, \nbut because he's an obvious buffoon, many people accept that as the reason everything's \ngoing horribly wrong. It's also a lot less distressing to believe that your government is incompetent rather than know that they're evil, and most people will cling to that comfort.\n\n               The real problem is that if people blame Bush's idiocy for our troubles, they probably also think that the solution would be to get him out of office, but if they think we'll be saved by ""Hillary in '08,"" or any other politician, they're even slower than Bush. \n\nRegardless of who's occupying the White House, there has never been an idiot running this country. There's  too much power and money at stake for an idiot to gain control of it. If the president is an idiot,  he's only in the White House because someone else has firm control over him. Someone somewhere has a lot more control over the fate of this nation than our ""president"" does. \n\n               Of course this reasoning begs the question ""if this country isn't being run by an idiot, \nwhy is everything going so horribly wrong?"" The answer is that it's going wrong by design. \nThe questioner makes the  assumption that this country is being run by people who are acting in the interest of Americans, but nothing can be further from the truth. Instead of accusing Bush of doing a lousy job, or being a lousy president, please try to think in terms of Bush's ""boss"" being someone other than the American people, and his ""job"" as being to grab as \nmuch cash as he can for himself and his friends before driving this country into the ground. If you look at his presidency in that light, you can instantly see that he's doing a marvelous job, and he's the best ""president"" an enemy nation could ever hope to see in the White House.The fact of the matter is that America as we know it (or knew it) is being systematically destroyed, and the politicians from both political parties are making this possible.\n\n             Freedom and justice are fading memories, the U.S. Constitution is ""just a goddamn piece of paper,"" and the election process has been undermined. The jobs have been shipped overseas, the economy is hopeless, the environment is being raped, the Army is ""broken,"" the infrastructure is crumbling, our borders are being dissolved, and every dollar or gold nugget that was subject to being looted, is already gone. With the entire nation and its population deep in debt, crashing the economy is a simple matter of raising interest rates, which will allow the bankers to once again scoop up all mortgaged property, and force its inhabitants out into the street. Instead of calling it illegal immigration, we should be calling it a foreign invasion, because the consequences of this invasion are as terminal to our freedoms and to our way of life as any act of terrorism ever perpetrated against us!

9,"Yes, three times, and I appreciated the dispacter each time!!\n\n.. I live in a very rural area, it was winter, all 3 of my babies were home, my youngest being only 6 months old, babysitting another 3 month old for a girlfriend. Snow was on the ground pretty thick, front door was chain locked, and I thought manually locked too. Someone opened the door from the outside, saw the chain then closed the door again, I couldn't believe what I saw, so I went to my window to look out... no one there, no cars in my drive other than mine, I freaked, called 911, and began to speed read my situation over the phone, had to repeat it twice since the adrenalin rush of panic had taken over,  then a few minutes after giving my address and telling all the kids to be quiet like mice, and checking to make sure the back door was locked, I peeking out the front window again and again, the dispatch was very calming even though my heart was racing. Then I heard my garage door close, and as I was peeking out I saw my husband, he slid the car into the ditch up the road and had walked back.  I don't know how the dispatch ever understood a word of what I said, since I have the habit of talking fast anyway, but his patience and calm helped me, and his understanding of my husband being my break in, which I yelled about (I think while I was on the phone with him, for my husnband to ""NEVER DO THAT AGAIN"",) he made absolutely certain I was sure it was my husband before hanging up.. I thought he must have had a good chuckle over that one later..

9,"Marcel has made some good points, with the exception of the ending of the Vietnam War in 1973. Recently, in a debate about 'Deep Throat,' Pat Buchanan had stated that President Nixon had authorized the 1973 pullout from Vietnam as a means of getting peoples' minds off of Watergate. It is very unlikely that the war effort would have been terminated when it did, because earlier President Nixon had placed some very severe conditions on American withdrawal, but in 1973 they were all abandoned.\n\nSpecifically, President Nixon had made the following demands on North Vietnam and the Viet Cong:\n\n1-All foreign combatants to be withdrawn from South Vietnam - instead, the US accepted 'certification' that NVA units in South Vietnam would stay in place and not continue to attack.\n\n2-All American servicemen listed as prisoners would be returned to the USA or relevant explanations provided - the US had maintained that 1500 American servicemen were missing and assumed alive and captured in Laos by either the Pathet Lao or the North Vietnames Army, but the USA agreed to instead list them all as dead.\n\n3-Verifiable cease fire to be in place before the USA would withdraw forces - the USA agreed to drop this condition altogether.\n\nThe Christmas Bombings, largely credited with bringing the North Vietnamese back to Paris, would have probably been continued (with subsequent continuation of loss of B-52 bombers over Hanoi) until North Vietnam actually made agreements they would stick to. The USA would then have kept faith with South Vietnam in 1975 when the next round of incursions began, and hippies would then have assaulted President Reagan in 1977 for reinstituting the draft and sending troops back to South Vietnam and invading the Peoples Republic of China. In 1981, discredited by new military deadlocks in Shanghai, President Reagan would have been followed by President Edmund Muskie, the economy would have collapsed 1n 1983, and in 1984 President Muskie would have benn succeeded by President Gus Hall, perennial candidate of the American Communist Party. In 1989, President Hall would have broken ties with Moscow and alligned the PRUSA (Peoples' Republic of the United States of America) with Albania and Yugoslavia as a third tier of World Communism. World War III would have ensued."

As it is, under Republican policies - less than 5% of cargo is scanned for radioactive material.  And how about our ports? The less said there the better.

9,"I'm not sure ""greatness"" and ""improving the state of the nation"" should be the same yardsticks.  I consider Lincoln the greatest man because he worked his way up from poverty, was a great writer, thought deeply about philosophy and religion instead of just accepting the easy dogma of the culture or of one denomination, overcame depression, kept a sense of humor and humility, and was a skilled politician in the best sense of the word.  I'm probably overlooking many other aspects of his greatness as a human being.  You could argue that he did the most for improving the state of the nation by leading a second revolution with a goal of real equality, not just for prosperous white males, and getting rid of slavery.\n\nFor improving the state of the nation, it's a close call with Teddy Roosevelt, though.  Roosevelt led the way in taking the country back from the Robber Barons, who had trampled the working class for over a generation.  That's an aspect of American history that isn't covered much, but it certainly is relavent to today's situation, where the president is rabid about concentrating more wealth in the hands of the top 1% while the bottom 50% controls 2.5% of the private wealth of the nation"

9,NO.  President Bush is just a talking head puppet if you will for forces that control all governments.  I don't think the terrorist identified were responsible or had the resources to pull off an attack like that.  Our government is definitely covering up what happened that day.  There is overwhelming evidence to support that it was an inside job.  I don't think Bush is directly responsible but probably knows what happened.  Any agency or government institution that aids in the cover up or conceals evidence indirectly implies guilt.  They needed a new Pearl Harbor to gain support for there agenda.

9,"Speaking as a Soldier, I sure hope you can.  I know that there are many folks out there who feel that all Soldiers are warmongers who only want to go and kill and fight.  But for many of us, that isn't the case.  Soldiers (and this likely goes for all branches, not just the Army) join so that they can be a part of something that is historically honorable, noble, and disciplined.  Not everyone can be a servicemember.  It takes a definite commitment to a particular way of life.  Unfortunately, part-and-parcel to that way of life is the fact that when our government calls us to duty, we have to go whether we like the reasoning behind it or not.  That is not to say that Soldiers don't have choices.  We do. Some Soldiers have disgraced our ranks and performed heinous acts against enemy POW's like at the Ahgraib prison. But, part of our oath is that we will follow the ""lawful orders of those appointed over"" us.  A lawful order means that it abides by all of the rules of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the rules set forth by the Geneva Convention.\n\nWhether our government lied to get us into this war or it was simply as really dumb judgement call by the leadership is a subject that will likely be debated well into the future.

9,"As a former soldier i can agree with parts of the letter. I dont think that it is fair, or safe to assume that most young people who join the military are naive,I joined after Sept. 11, so i knew what was to come. i wasnt in a dead-end town, i didnt need the college money. i joined because after Sept. 11 happend i felt that it was what i was supposed to do, my dad, my grandfather serviced this country, so it was a questioin of ""if they did it then why shouldnt i"". i admit that it was hard to conform to what they wanted, to change my way of thinking and adpot theirs(i dont think i ever did). i wanted to speak out, and say i didnt agree with this, or i didnt agree with that. In the begining i was afraid, i didnt want my follow soldiers to think that i was different from them. so i didnt speak my mind, i was always the quite one, but as time went on and my military career grew i realized that i was going about it all wrong. the reason the military is what it is today is because we have soldiers who speak their minds, who arent afraid to say things, who are not afraid of change. the military needs this, if we just had robots then no one could lead when they needed them to, no one could step up and take charge in a deadly situation. i dont agree with the war, i never have and never will, but to me, its not a question of if you agree with the war or not as a soldier. its who will protect my family,the freedoms that i take advantage of as an American,its will you support, will you protect your follow soldier who has gone through basic training, who has been through all the bull**** that you have, that soldier who stands by you, even the ""disgruntaled soldiers"", its about the bond that you and your follow soldiers have and no one else can understand. no civilan can understand what a soldier goes thourgh, what they have been though, thats a secert shared by only the soldiers and no one can take that away from them.i may not agree with everyting the letter says, but as i follow soldier i understand it and i can respect it. i say bravo to J.D. Englehart for writing this letter, for saying what is on is mind and so many other soldiers. to me this is what American needs, to hear different truths and realize even as a soldier you do have an opinion."

If she is a nurse, therefore she has a degree but it doesn't sound like she is an Office eiher. But if that's the case, she cannot get out of it. That's considered dessertion and you go to jail for it. \nIf she is going to Iraq as a Nurse working for the goverment contractors she can get out of it. Most likely she signed a contract, tell her to read very well the clause about rescinding the contract. I have knows of people going to Iraq and stayed less than the contract stated.

9,"The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) is an investigation project to ""understand, simulate and control ionospheric processes that might alter the performance of communication and surveillance systems"". Started in 1993, the project is proposed to last for a period of twenty years.\n\nThe project is jointly funded by the United States Air Force, the Navy, and the University of Alaska. It is said that the project is similar to numerous existing ionospheric heaters around the world, and has a large suite of diagnostic instruments that facilitate its use to increase scientific understanding of ionospheric dynamics. It is a popular target of conspiracy theories, and though many have expressed fears of the HAARP being used as a nefarious weapon, the scientists involved in aeronomy, space science, or plasma physics reject these fears as unfounded.\nContents\n[show]\n\n    * 1 The HAARP site\n          o 1.1 Ionospheric heating facilities\n                + 1.1.1 Platteville\n                + 1.1.2 Current facilities\n                + 1.1.3 HAARP management\n          o 1.2 Diagnostic instrumentation\n    * 2 Research at the HAARP\n    * 3 Stated objectives\n    * 4 HAARP controversy\n          o 4.1 The HAARP's critics\n                + 4.1.1 Waste\n                + 4.1.2 Weapon\n                + 4.1.3 Energy Transmitter\n                + 4.1.4 Russians\n          o 4.2 HAARP's supporters\n    * 5 See also\n    * 6 Patents\n    * 7 External links\n\n[edit]\n\nThe HAARP site\n\nThe project site is near Gakona, Alaska (lat. 62.39° N, long 145.15° W), just West of the Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park. An environmental impact statement led to permission for an array of up to 180 antennas to be erected. The HAARP has been constructed at the previous site of an over-the-horizon radar installation. A large structure, built to house the OTH now houses the HAARP control room, kitchen, and offices. Several other small structures house various instruments. The Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI) is the primary instrument at HAARP, which is a high-frequency (HF) transmitter system used to temporarily modify the ionosphere. Study of this modified volume yields important information for understanding natural ionospheric processes.\n\nDuring active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmitter system is delivered to the antenna array, transmitted in an upward direction, and is partially absorbed, at an altitude between 100 to 350 km (depending on operating frequency), in a small volume a few hundred meters thick and a few tens of kilometers in diameter over the site. The intensity of the HF signal in the ionosphere is less than 3 µW/cm2, tens of thousands of times less than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth and hundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity of the Sun's natural ultraviolet (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. The small effects that are produced, however, can be observed with the sensitive scientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility and these observations can provide new information about the dynamics of plasmas and new insight into the processes of solar-terrestrial interactions. [2]\n\nThe HAARP site has been constructed in three distinct phases. The Developmental Prototype (DP) had 18 antenna elements, organized in three columns by six rows. It was fed with a total of 360 kilowatts (kW) combined transmitter output power.

9,"The third verse of the US National Anthem:\n\n""And where is that band who so vauntingly swore \nThat the havoc of war and the battle's confusion \nA home and a country should leave us no more? \nTheir blood has wiped out their foul footsteps' pollution. \nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave \nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: \nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave \nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."""
9,"If you are talking about conserving energy - this will not solve the energy problem. It's only part of the solution. What really solves the problem is drilling and refining our own sources of energy off of our coasts and in ANWR - but that won't happen because tree hugging pus*y liberals like yourself would rather block domestic energy production and then whine about gas prices being too high. That's why there hasn't been an oil refinery built in this country for over 30 years. That's why they have brownouts in California. All because of the environmental movement and their hatred of Capitalism. Raising the supply of energy is a sure fire way to make sure we never run out.\n\nThis is true of ANY commodity. Let's take Coca Cola for example. The reason a 12oz can of Coke only costs 75 cents from a vending machine is because that is the price that the market will bear. Now, close every Coca-Cola bottling plant in the country except one and keep the same amount of vending machines - what do you think would happen to the price? It would skyrocket because there wouldn't be enough Coke to fill the vending machine demand.\n\nOn the other hand, if you openend up Coca-Cola bottling plants on every steet corner in America - there would be so much Coke available that the price would plummet because they would have more Coca-Cola than vending machines to dispense them.\n\nThe same would be true whether you are talking about energy, Coca-Cola, steel, guns, butter or newspapers.\n\nInstead of spouting off from your a$$, maybe you should learn some Economic facts first."

The primary quality of a good pilot, for any aircraft, is the ability to make sound judgments, always plan ahead, stay focused, and continually generate new back-up plans. This skill set is transferable to any form of aircraft.\n\nAfter that, it's a matter of mastering the aircraft so it performs in accordance with your will. That's a matter of training and practice.\nI'm just a simple balloonist, but I've met a lot of balloon pilots that are also rated for both fixed-wing and rotorcraft.

It was more about being one enormous cock up with faulty intelligence being taken as fact, posturing from Saddam and al Qaeda camps sprouting up at the same time.\n\nIn the end everyone lost patience and their heads and forgot that violence and war simply doesn't solve problems only causes people to entrench their views.\n\nI agree the Iran crisis has to be solved, but I do not think that America will solve it with an attack.

9,"The system functions to maintain the status quo. Wealthy white males protect their station in drafting, enacting, and enforcing their ideology. Mainly, that wealthy, white males are the only ones capable and intellegent enough to draft, enact and enforce laws. Read the Reimen book, The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Prison. If you are really interested in how the system works.\n\nIn prior years, I would have said that there is no consistency in the american judicial system; that, infact, it was the most arbitrary and capricious system ever developed. Now, with manditory minimum sentencing and all of the well intended groups getting their special laws and penalties for newly rewritten laws to set out with specificity their group, draconian sentencing seems to be a consistency in the law. \n\nYet, prosecutors still hide exculpatory evidence and misrepresent the facts to the jurors to ensure victory and reelection or to move to the next political arena. Through the unfortunate situation of mostly poor people getting arrested, the system grind on...Its like this: The case is tried by the Judge which is an elected position (popularity contest) and he/she acts under color of authority for the State; the Prosecutor, also an elected position is also a State agent; if the person arrested is poor that person will be represented by a public defender....you guessed it a State appointed attorney. The legal process is suppose to be a rigorous testing of the facts and an adversarial process. NOW, you tell if the state hears the case (judge) and it is prosecuted by the state (prosecutor) and the defendant is represented by the state (State PD), I ask you where is the adversarial process. I would say that the consistency of law is that it does not apply (normally) to wealthy white males."

Of course, if the negative work history is substantiated in documentation such as merit reviews, the former employers bears little risk in the event of adverse legal action.

9,"Hi there,\n\nHere's what I found:\n\nDutch senate endorses bill on deals with criminals - 12 May 2005\n\nThe Dutch Upper House of Parliament has endorsed a Bill on guarantees to witnesses in criminal cases, also referred to as ‘deals with criminals’. As a result of the arrangement, the Public Prosecution Service (OM) may promise to reduce the sentence by no more than half of the sentence that the public prosecutor intends to demand. This will occur when a suspect is willing to make an incriminating witness statement in criminal proceedings against another suspect. \n\nThe examining magistrate checks the agreement in the preliminary inquiry, before ‘the deal’ is done. The public prosecutor provides the examining judge with all relevant information so he can decide on the agreement. \n\nThe legislative proposal also contains the provision that a statement that has once been promised cannot be withdrawn without having any consequences. Someone who intentionally makes no statement will be punished with imprisonment of up to one year. The Bill is in line with the Van Traa Committee that concludes that a statutory arrangement is required for deals with criminals. Thanks to a subsequent motion tabled by MP Kalsbeek, the prior testing by the judge was included in the Bill. \n\nThe Board of Procurators General will be requested to come up with a proposal for an instruction on the practical application of the new statutory arrangement."
9,"I'm not an attorney but, I'm qualified to answer this question as an ex-con, who has spent time behind the walls, and then survived three revocation hearings on a suspended sentence I recieced after being in prison. \n\nSo let me tell you what has happened to get you to this point and I've never met you. You have most likely failed a U.A., failed to appear as directed, haven't paid fees, court cost or resition, caught a new charge or failed to go to couseling, A.A. or do community service. Something along those lines. \n\nWhen that happened you P.O. send a affidavit ( a sworn statement) to the D.A.'s office. They have filed what is called an ""application to accerate"" and are asking for a hearing (called a revocation hearing) to take away your probation status. \n\nHere is what is going to happen. Nothing for a while, the process sometimes moves slowly, meaning it may take the D.A's office a few weeks to get the paperwork filed but, I assure you they have'nt forgotten about it. \n\nAn amended affidavit, is an affidavit that has been modified since the original was taken. The D.A. has found something ""materially wrong"" with your P.O.'s affidavit OR\nthey have amended the original affidavit to ""include some other infraction"" they aledge you have done. \n\nOnce the application to accerate is filed the judge will issue a arrest warrent and you will have to post bond again to bond you over, as a means of guarenteing you will appear for the revocation hearing.\n\nHere is how you stay out of jail 1) don't catch a new case 2) call a bonds man, once or twice a week and have him check to see if a warrent has been issued. 3) when it is issued, you go to the courthouse with the bonds men and surrender yourself as he post bond. They make take you in custady for a short while, in order to go through the booking process. \n\nIf you don't get booked in when he post bond, then they will do it when you make your inital appearace at the arrangment hearing. Either way, you should be home for dinner that night and you can plan your schedual to be taken in to custady for a few hours, rather than being picked up without a minuted notice. \n\nUntil, the warrent is issued here is what you do. Keep reporting in to you P.O. and following the other terms of your probation. BUT BEFORE YOU GO TO YOUR PROBATION OFFICE ALWAYS, FIRST CALL THE BONDSMAN AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE WARRENT. Your P.O. will have you picked up in his office, if you show up there, with a current warrent out for your arrest. If he tells you otherwise, don't believe him. It is a trap.\n\nBut, you can't quit checking in, just because you know one day this hearing is going down. However, if you have an appointment with him and find out you have a warrent don;t go. Call enstead and tell him that you can't make your appointment, because you have a warrent out. But you want him know what is going on. And you are working with a bondsman and will see him next week, once you are bound over.\n\nThe way you beat the case is to correct, whatever it is they aledge you have done or not done. If you haven't been paying fees, start paying fees. If you haven't been reporting, start reporting. If you have a hot U.A. start going to A.A. and get someone to sign your paper that you attended or better yet go to treatment. If you have any new charges and don't have a substance abuse problem, I don't know what you do. But if you have a new charge, a DUI, Public Drunk or possession charge you have to take drastic measures and go to 30 day primary inpaient treatment. \n\nYou can't wait until later and try to bargain with it. Judges don't bargain. You have to show your willingness up front, with no gurantees of lenancy. That is just the way it works. But, it works.\n\nYou want as many continuances that your attorney can get the Judge to agree to. Time is on your side in this situation. You want to put "

9,"Please don't be misled by the previous responder. You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce."

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n\nSection 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age,(See Note 15) and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. \n\nSection 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. \n\nSection 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void. \n\nSection 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."
9,"We covered this in my Contemporary Moral Problems class. It really made me think about it in a different way in that I was kind of oblivious to how it could be abused. I always thought that if someone wanted to end his or her own life, they should be able to do so, especially if they were in any sort of pain. I realize that sucks for the family and friends of that person, but if they really cared about the person, they would understand and at least be there for them. But then you have to think about the Teri Shivos of the world who never mentioned whether or not they would want to be kept alive. The power now lies in the hands of the family and doctors. I think a better question here would be who should be allowed to handle such a decision. That involves an issue of power- a power perhaps no one should have over anyone. That could lead to someone killing another out of spite or even out of some sort of monetary gain. While I completely agree that if someone wants to end their life, they should be able to- but some serious thought needs to go into who should have the power if someone is unable to make that decision for themselves."

A responsible nation that would not use nuclear weapons without dire provocation. A nation that can be mostly trusted not to sell these weapons or through negligence allow these weapons or materials to make them fall into terrorist hands. \n\nIran, making a first stab at Democracy but suffered a severe set back in last elections. A very regimented society bereft of many freedoms Westerners take for granted.  An unstable government leads a nation with a president who actually claims the Holocust never happened. As bad as Western leaders have been in the last 40 years there have been none that were openly delusional like this.  Iran has ties with terrorist organizations and it's Gov is riddled with terrorist sympathizers. It is almost certain that nuclear weapons in Iran or even the materials to make them if the weapons did not exist would fall into the hands of terrorists. Even if the Gov honestly attempted to stop it, there is too much support for terrorism in segments of Iranian society to stop such theft. \n\nIn short, India has the bomb life goes on as always. Iran has the bomb or even the materials needed for one, at least one major city will be blown up killing at least 2 million people. After which a war would start that would likely erase man from the face of the planet. \n\nIslamics somehow thing they can use biological and nuclear weapons and not see their own children if not the entire race wiped off the planet. Why this I would love to hear.

9,"wow, never thought of that before! I don't know about books, but I do know that the prevailing thought is that we should be careful what we let ourselves/our children watch on TV or play when it comes to videogames. I mean, there are all those cases, especially in America, where teenagers, and even younger children, have killed their families, strangers or fellow students. And have admitted that their behaviour was influenced by the violent videogames/playstation games they play. It's a modern phenomenon, and one we need to combat.\nBut I think books could definitely have the same effect, especially on the impressionable young mind. We should be careful."

But it is afraid of US's democratic tellings would attract Iranian people, who want a deep regime change and want more liberty. In Iran the supreme authority is the Religious Leader: Hamaney. Hamaney demands one thing from the US: the guarantee of the religious regime of Iran. If this is met, then Iran would stop its nuclear program at just that moment. But it seems that the situation is worsening, I think it will be too late for both sides. Because I have a thesis, an Iran-US war (I think won't be such a war but if) would cause not a winner but two losers. This would change the history of all middle east and US. It would destroy all histories..."

9,"The training in ANY branch is absolutely ""no harder than it needs to be"".  You'll notice that I put that in quotes.  The saying is old, but it's true.  The idea behind the training is to keep you alive in a combat situation.  Is it hard?  Yes.  Is it too hard?  Depends on how much you value your life, honestly.  The USAF training is not too hard, because they are not on the ground.  USN focuses on swimming and staying alive in water (go figure).  The Army and Marines training is harder (USMC is harder and longer), because they are on the ground and doing the dirty.\n\nWhich branch would I recommend?  The branch that offers YOU the best deal for YOU!  I spent 20 years in the Army, and was a recruiter.  I know that the Army has the best deal out there, but it's YOUR life, YOUR decision.  You need to sit down with each branch, get your information, and make your decision after reviewing ALL the material.\n\nGED?  That's a timing issue.  If you have some college, that will help.  If you can score over 50 on the ASVAB, that will help.  That's another issue that needs to be brought up with the recruiting offices. \n\nGood luck"

9,"i think its a difficult issue. i think that we are in the war for the wrong reasons, but i think the war is necessary. the us being on a different continent than most major wars has always been torn between getting involved and isolationism. we dont always make the right call. i think that the people in iraq and the surrounding regions needed help. needed military assistance. not to make way for democracy or any of that crap. but because of massive human rights violations. thats not why we got into the war of course, but its certainly a beneficial side effect. the us didnt get into WWII to liberate the concentration camps, and stop the slaughter of innocent people all over europe, but again, a positive side effect. so maybe it doesnt matter what reason we go in for, as long as the right thing gets done. the civilian casualties are appalling. but they are mostly due to the iraqi insurgency. of course the iraqi insurgency would not have happened if we hadnt gotten involved, because their aims were being accomplished by saddam hussein. and they'll be there when we leave. i dont know that the middle east is actually a good place for democracy. they evolved differently than america and europe. they may require a different form of government. in the end i dont care. the people will decide, and it will be bloody and violent, as it always is. most really important decisions are. but i think its probably time we got out. but as long as we helped people who needed it, maybe its not such a bad thing we got involved. and before you ask, yes i believe that our next stop should be darfour, and the other places in africa where appalling genocide is taking place. it seems we cant win. some countries tell us to mind our own business. others ask us where the hell we were when they were in trouble. like i said. its complex. i dont think theres a right answer."

In the Everson Case, Justice Black purposely misinterpreted a letter sent from Thomas Jefferson to a group of  Baptist clergymen to indicate Jefferson supported such a separation. The ministers wrote Jefferson about their fear that the powerful Congregationalist Church and its teachings would become the national religion. Jefferson responded that he favored ""a wall of separation"" between government and religion to prevent any faith from becoming the national religion. He did not mention any of the stupidity promoted nowadays to take God's name off coins, out of the national anthem or pledge of allegiance, or to restrict the displays of  religious symbolism."
9,"This is gonna be a popular question...\n\nI'd say pretty rank.  Whether Republican or Democrat, you can't be very pleased.  The reasons for Dems to hate him are readily apparent, but what if you're a conservative?  Thanks to W. you now have less freedom, less protection from government intrusion, bigger government, bigger budgets, and REALLY big deficits.  Which means higher taxes.  Unless you plan to die in the next 5 years, you'll pay more in taxes thanks to Bush.  Instead of having to pay an extra dollar in taxes today, you'll pay about $1.35 in 5 years.\n\nThe ""Security"" president ignored the warnings about the 9/11 attacks.  The ""defense"" president cut the budget for veterans' benefits and combat pay, and his defense secretary has so politicized the military that the highest ranking generals retired.  And he destroyed America's ability to wage two separate wars, allowing both Iran and Korea free to develop nukes.  The ""uniter not a divider"" will forever be known in Bartlett's for ""You're either with us or against us.""  The ""education president"" enacted so many regulations that schools have had to cut teaching positions to pay the cost of fulfilling them.  The ""values"" resident has an administration riddled with corruption, criminals, and total disregard for anyone but themselves. But I go on...\n\nSimply put, there are a number of men whose presidencies are considered abject failures.  But this is almost exclusively because they did little or nothing during their term of office. This Bush will go down in history for his active hypocrisy, destruction of basic American values, of the military, of the judiciary, and the end of the American Century.\n\nAnd wait'll you hear what the left has to say about him."
9,Yes!  I think he not only attempted to kill him. I think he DID kill him. Its just a right wing consipiracy that is trying to have it seem like he is alive. They are using trick photography you know.  But they assinated him so Cheney could get his heart. Cheneys been looking for a new heart transplant and Whittington was a perfect match.  They have also killed all of Whittingtons family.  they have just hid all this from the press.

9,"Malaysia is NOT better without Singapore, but Singapore IS better without Malaysia.\nMalaysia had a chance to become a better country in the early '60s, when Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP were rallying the minorities of Malaysia to stand up and be counted.  But then, what did the Tunku do but tell S'pore that it had to go its own way...\nNow look at the two countries.  Everyone in S'pore, no matter what their race, stands equal before the law, has an equal chance for success, and lives in prosperity.  Malaysia has rampant poverty, and still to this day discriminates in favor of the Malay majority while marginalizing minority groups.  These are not characteristics of a civilized nation.\nSo, ask yourself: Who is better without whom?\n...but then again, I'm just an ignorant foreigner...right?"

9,"I'm not sure why you care. Is it for the monetary benefits they could then enjoy as a legally married couple? If it's not about money, then why make such a big deal about it? The bottom line is how two people feel about one another and not some definition of ""marriage"" that society chooses to make. I think I'd revere two people who were dedicated to one another who didn't need the formality of marriage as a crutch. Spend your time living life, not debating it.\n\nIn my opinion, the basis of your arguments are that you want society to accept homosexuality as a normal human condition. Unfortunately, homosexuality is not a normal human condition by definition because reproduction is necessary to preserve the species as it is with any animal on earth. It's true that 10% of the population is genetically homosexual, but so is 10% of the population deaf or blind, but that doesn't make it normal. On the other hand, skin color, nationality, culture, gender, and other potential racially related discriminant features are simply manifestations of human evolution on earth. Darwin's theory of evolution cannot support homosexuality as a normal development of mankind."

9,"This is merely opinion.\n\nI don't think the majority of the American people have a problem with the majority of the Iranian people.  However, there is a small minority of people in Iran that seem to be intent on the destruction of the United States.  Some of those people are now in power in Iran.\n\nYou ask why we think Iran is more dangerous?  Probably because those other countries' leaders have not openly called the United States ""The Great Satan"".  Probably because those countries aren't broadcasting constant anti-American propaganda.  \n\nWe have no problem with the people of Iran.  But we do have a problem with fanatic people in ANY nation who would illogically choose to use nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction because we choose not to follow Islam.  \n\nAnd, why is there so much fervor over a silly cartoon?  Yes, I agree that the cartoon profanes your prophet - peace be upon him, and I think it was in poor taste for them to do that.  But I've had people profane my God every day on here, and in the media.  I don't like it, but I'm not about to demonstrate and/or demand that they die or anything like that.\n\nIf leaders of Islam would demonstrate some tolerance and love towards America, we might see Islam in the light that your Prophet - peace be upon him - wanted the world to see."

9,"It's considered reckless driving in NJ and it seems to be the only state with a clear law about this so far.  If you fall asleep and kill someone there it's vehicular homicide and up to 10 years in prison.  They say it's illegal to drive if you haven't slept for more than 24 hours.  I don't know how they can prove that part.  \n\nOther states are trying to pass a similar law. ""Michigan and Massachusetts plan to amend current laws to include fatigue as a factor of reckless driving."" and NY wants to make it a Class A misdemeanor if you're overtired and driving. \n\nIt could be careless or reckless driving.  They seem to charge people with those things if they don't know what else to do.  Even though it doesn't seem to be listed as a type of reckless driving in MA, it doesn't mean they won't find a way to charge you with it anyway.  I got charged with reckless driving in CT for rolling a car down a hill at 10 mph without the engine running.  It rolled into a ditch because the breaks locked up.  No other cars were around and no one got hurt.  If the cop is a jerk, he'll come up with a charge."

9,This will take a significant amount of work.\n\nThe actual budget you can get a copy of through your elected representative.  It may even be available on a disk.  If you seek on the internet it is possible to find such on a disk from a private company but it will cost money.\n\nTo the total cost of IT means that you will you have to go through each Agenmcy's/ Depatment's line item budget.  I don't believe that there are common account numbers across all agencies/departments.\n\nEven when you are through with that project you  will only have a part of the IT cost because for cetain agencies these figures are behind security walls.\n\nGood Luck.

9,NO. I have friends and family who are in Iraq in the military and my father in law just got back from Iraq as a civilian bomb dog handler. Each of them has told me how saddened and sickened they are by the media portrayal of only negative things from the war. Each of them has told me about how they can see positive changes in Iraq and how much better the living conditions are over there now and how they have started schools and brought order back in many places. I don't think that is a waste of time. It is hard for us who have people we love over there and I am sure we would like to see them all come home safely and not have to be at war -- but the efforts made my our troops in Iraq are not a waste of time.
